In the last decade, there are many interesting developments in databases and distributed systems:
- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google are handling huge volumes of data and traffic, so they need new tools to handle such scale efficiently.
- Businesses need to be agile, so they need to keep develpoment cycle short and data models flexible.
- The number of core and network speeds are increasing, but CPU clock speeds are barely so, it means parallelism is only gonna increase
- Thanks to Infra-structure as a Service, you can now build distributed systems across many machines and even multiple geographic regions.
