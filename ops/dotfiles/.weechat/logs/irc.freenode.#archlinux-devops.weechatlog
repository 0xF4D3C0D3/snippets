2020-12-21 03:23:31	grazzolni|M	foutrelis: they should be on ansible too.
2020-12-21 03:23:47	foutrelis	grazzolni|M: it's luna so not ansible'd
2020-12-21 03:24:10	Foxboron	jelle: Allan is the best example I have. But this is about everyone that has git.a.o as their upstream. You can't just ignore their wishes

2020-12-21 03:26:46	foutrelis	ye
2020-12-21 03:26:52	jelle	you mean merge the role or?
2020-12-21 03:26:54	grazzolni|M	foutrelis: ah right, it's on luna. argh
2020-12-21 03:27:18	foutrelis	jelle: you enabled mirrors to sync the links dbs, so it's kind of redundant
2020-12-21 03:27:33	jelle	foutrelis: hmmmmm
2020-12-21 03:27:55	foutrelis	I mean dragon runs both createlinks and would also sync the links dbs from gemini if the syncrepo role was re-applied to it
2020-12-21 03:28:09	jelle	dragon runs createlinks hmm
2020-12-21 03:28:17	foutrelis	ye, it shouldn't now
2020-12-21 03:28:30	jelle	I see
2020-12-21 03:28:31	foutrelis	createlinks only makes sense for gemini, no?
2020-12-21 03:28:41	jelle	I kinda don't like the dbscripts role containing svntogit
2020-12-21 03:28:51	jelle	it's huge to run
2020-12-21 03:29:33	foutrelis	could tags be used to exclude those tasks?
2020-12-21 03:29:35	grazzolni|M	jelle: slow
2020-12-21 03:30:52	foutrelis	jelle: or, it's going away anyway when we migrate to git :P
2020-12-21 03:30:58	jelle	foutrelis: :P
2020-12-21 03:34:18	foutrelis	so, I think only dragon and gemini have sogrep, I should be able to create an MR to merge sogrep into dbscripts in the next few days
2020-12-21 03:34:29	grazzolni|M	jelle: almost forgot, can you do a double check backups are working on al.org?

2020-12-21 03:34:56	grazzolni|M	jelle: ok
2020-12-21 03:35:17	grazzolni|M	from what I saw it's working, but doesn't hurt to double check
2020-12-21 03:35:36	jelle	will do
2020-12-21 03:46:36	jelle	ok time to fix nginx
2020-12-21 03:48:04	grazzolni|M	jelle: what's broken/
2020-12-21 03:48:05	grazzolni|M	?
2020-12-21 03:48:17	jelle	grazzolni|M: got some performance issue with rebuilderd and proxy pass
2020-12-21 03:48:26	grazzolni|M	ah, I see
2020-12-21 03:48:38	jelle	grazzolni|M: if the response is too big from rebuilderd it's like 3 x slower
2020-12-21 03:53:55	jelle	grazzolni|M: I think I need to tweak the proxy_buffering cache

2020-12-22 07:32:04	kevr	i think i'll just have folks create the DB models as they need them when porting routes so we could progressively implement them.

2020-12-22 07:33:45	kevr	as far as the first user auth step goes: i'm gonna be porting over the same auth tactic used in aurweb's php; previously there was worked started on aurweb.routers.sso, that intends to introduce some oauth/sso integration into fastapi, however i'm not touching any of that yet until after the base port is complete.

2020-12-22 20:25:45	jelle	not sure how MTR works
2020-12-22 20:27:00	jelle	grazzolni|M: delete source branch is uncommented, so merging is fine no?
2020-12-22 20:27:22	grazzolni|M	jelle: yeah, just so you resist the temptation of checking that box =D
2020-12-22 20:27:59	jelle	ejsav: so if you have a clue https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jelly/1be9ea413b8c8b6b95b733fe8dd62ef9/raw/83c607f394b37dbb07c738e68f428b75d217da6f/mtr.log :D

2020-12-22 20:29:11	 *	jelle is confused
2020-12-22 20:29:58	ejsav	what's the question?
2020-12-22 20:30:51	jelle	grazzolni|M: weird thing is https://archlinux.org/mirrors/wrz.de/1311/ check ip lists something not gemini

2020-12-22 20:31:18	jelle	seems that is apollo

2020-12-22 20:31:36	jelle	no it ain't wat
2020-12-22 20:32:05	jelle	I can't ping 88.198.91.70
2020-12-22 20:33:42	jelle	I give u
2020-12-22 20:33:51	wCPO	jelle: it is orion according to git
2020-12-22 20:33:59	jelle	wCPO: lol wat
2020-12-22 20:34:06	jelle	that makes sense
2020-12-22 20:34:32	jelle	wCPO: also that domain is still in some spf record
2020-12-22 20:34:59	jelle	freswa: seems orion is still in spf1, I don't think we want that? :D
2020-12-22 20:35:09	jelle	well now I know how it works again /o\
2020-12-22 20:35:17	ejsav	with mtr it might be helpful if you hit D a couple of times to switch the display mode
2020-12-22 20:35:19	jelle	Yeah
2020-12-22 20:35:46	jelle	wCPO: https://dodgy.download/AwfulMaroonLobster.png ^_^
2020-12-22 20:36:17	jelle	oh lord
2020-12-22 20:36:57	wCPO	did archlinux.org just die?
2020-12-22 20:37:07	jelle	wCPO: I just asked django to remove some old records :P

2020-12-22 20:37:31	jelle	this is fine
2020-12-22 20:37:49	ejsav	no caching mechanism?
2020-12-22 20:37:57	jelle	ejsav: caching?
2020-12-22 20:38:25	jelle	it does caching, doesn't help with cpu bound issues :)
2020-12-22 20:38:34	ejsav	ahh indeed
2020-12-22 20:39:10	jelle	still gonna delete that model tho
2020-12-22 20:40:25	ejsav	I was assuming you might have some upstream cache like Varnish or a CDN
2020-12-22 20:40:29	ejsav	don't know anything about the Arch infrastructure
2020-12-22 20:40:34	jelle	oh no we don't
2020-12-22 20:40:45	ejsav	sorry I'm just hangin' out :P
2020-12-22 20:40:47	jelle	np :)
2020-12-22 20:40:58	jelle	grazzolni|M: updated https://archlinux.org/admin/mirrors/checklocation/

2020-12-22 20:41:28	jelle	I should later make one of the kape boxes maybe do mirror monitoring as well, then we don't can check if it's maybe hetzner :P
2020-12-22 20:42:30	grazzolni|M	jelle: makes sense
2020-12-22 20:42:59	jelle	ok postgres doesn't lke me
2020-12-22 20:43:03	jelle	or we are swapping :P
2020-12-22 20:46:49	ejsav	do you have swap enabled on a db server? :P
2020-12-22 20:46:54	jelle	hashworks: this was the issue for our pour two cpus {'mirrors.MirrorLog': 2959803}
2020-12-22 20:46:55	jelle	ejsav: ofc
2020-12-22 20:47:36	grazzolni|M	jelle: perhaps we should increase the machine?
2020-12-22 20:47:41	jelle	grazzolni|M: mwoah
2020-12-22 20:47:57	hashworks	jelle: Nice
2020-12-22 20:48:18	jelle	grazzolni|M: this won't happen often, let's monitor the situation
2020-12-22 20:48:35	hashworks	How often does the sync happen? I'm currently adjusting archlinux-docker so it won't depend on the sync
2020-12-22 20:48:35	jelle	kinda interesting how uwsgi uses a lot of memory
2020-12-22 20:48:49	hashworks	Basically we can adjust it so it only syncs every 24h or so
2020-12-22 20:50:45	jelle	grazzolni|M: we might need to tune postgresql instead
2020-12-22 20:51:30	grazzolni|M	jelle: tune in what sense?
2020-12-22 20:51:40	jelle	grazzolni|M: to use less memory maybe
2020-12-22 20:51:51	grazzolni|M	jelle: it's already using 128m
2020-12-22 20:51:57	jelle	ah
2020-12-22 20:52:38	jelle	grazzolni|M: most of the tables are tiny, except package files / mirrorlog :)
2020-12-22 20:52:45	grazzolni|M	yeah
2020-12-22 20:53:08	jelle	2500 MB in total now hmm
2020-12-22 20:53:33	jelle	grazzolni|M: hmm we have 12 uwsgi processes, maybe that's an issue ^_^
2020-12-22 20:53:56	jelle	site works fine regardless
2020-12-22 20:54:18	grazzolni|M	jelle: we could decrease uwsgi stuff
2020-12-22 20:54:20	grazzolni|M	for sure
2020-12-22 20:55:04	jelle	not sure where that number comes from
2020-12-22 20:55:21	jelle	6 processes, 2 threads
2020-12-22 20:59:55	grazzolni|M	jelle: /etc/uwsgi/vassals/archweb.ini
2020-12-22 21:01:51	jelle	grazzolni|M: yeah found it :)
2020-12-22 21:01:59	jelle	grazzolni|M: I'm happy to spend some time optimizing things :P
2020-12-22 21:02:36	grazzolni|M	jelle: I think we can go with 3 processes 2 threads
2020-12-22 21:29:49	freswa	grazzolni|M: are you doing the patchwork migration?
2020-12-22 21:30:03	grazzolni|M	freswa: yes
2020-12-22 21:30:12	grazzolni|M	I was about to check with you
2020-12-22 21:30:22	grazzolni|M	what is needed for the mail stuff
2020-12-22 21:30:32	grazzolni|M	do I need rspamd, unbound, etc on the playbook?
2020-12-22 21:30:44	freswa	I thought about just using fetchmail for patchwork
2020-12-22 21:31:45	freswa	Otherwise we'll have another relayhost that also receives mails and the mess gets even bigger

2020-12-22 21:33:17	freswa	iirc patchwork doesn't send mail, does it?
2020-12-22 21:33:22	grazzolni|M	freswa: well, after patchwork is migrated, we can change apollo's conf to be just relay
2020-12-22 21:33:32	grazzolni|M	freswa: well, it does.
2020-12-22 21:33:41	grazzolni|M	it's a django application
2020-12-22 21:34:17	freswa	then let's use a plain relay postfix setup for outgoing mails and fetchmail for incoming stuff
2020-12-22 21:36:16	grazzolni|M	freswa: but is it something that's easy to do right now? otherwise I'll migrate it, the receiving part is contained to just one machine
2020-12-22 21:36:38	freswa	fetchmail is easy, yes
2020-12-22 21:36:45	freswa	I can move it to community now
2020-12-22 21:37:02	freswa	And configuration is just a few lines
2020-12-22 21:39:54	grazzolni|M	freswa: can you then make the required changes on the patchwork.archlinux.org branch?
2020-12-22 21:44:54	freswa	sure
2020-12-22 21:46:01	grazzolni|M	freswa: I'll add the patchwork playbook now
2020-12-22 21:46:29	freswa	I'll need some time cause I'm heading into a meeting now.
2020-12-22 21:46:54	freswa	I think I'll get this done today
2020-12-22 21:47:16	grazzolni|M	freswa: no problem. I'm going to do this: I'll add the patchwork playbook with regular relay stuff. will drop the rspamd, and all the extra stuff. and I'll run it so we have a relay user created and all
2020-12-22 21:47:31	freswa	great
2020-12-22 21:47:33	grazzolni|M	I'll run the book so I can also get a start on the migration itself
2020-12-22 21:47:39	grazzolni|M	then you can make the changes you want later to the book
2020-12-22 21:48:02	freswa	We have to change the special handling of the patchwork mails to end up in a *ususal* mbox
2020-12-22 21:48:42	grazzolni|M	freswa: I'm more concerned about the script that reads that and feeds them to patchwork
2020-12-22 21:48:51	grazzolni|M	I remember it being finnicky

2020-12-25 09:35:39	Foxboron	svenstaro: maybe a "Conference" grouP?

2020-12-25 09:35:46	Foxboron	or folder
2020-12-25 09:35:58	svenstaro	are we expecting more stuff in there?
2020-12-25 09:37:37	Foxboron	static stuff and the conf website. Might be too little for a folder?
2020-12-25 09:39:01	svenstaro	hmmm yeah maybe. Do you think it would be organisationally advantageous to keep the static stuff separate from the site?
2020-12-25 09:39:16	svenstaro	I suppose the static stuff could potentially be presented in other contexts than the site
2020-12-25 09:40:44	Foxboron	Maybe? FOSDEM/CCC pictures and/or hackathon picture?
2020-12-25 09:40:49	Foxboron	Repro summits and stuff

2020-12-25 09:40:58	svenstaro	yeah good enough
2020-12-25 09:41:19	svenstaro	gotta check if direct-linked LFS things have correct mime types
2020-12-25 09:41:25	svenstaro	otherwise we gotta get creative
2020-12-25 09:41:30	Foxboron	but I'd rather keep it flat then a folder for a repo :p But i thought it would be nicer to have the relevant projects grouped together
2020-12-25 09:44:41	svenstaro	actually there's a technical reason to separate them: lfs and github mirrors
2020-12-25 09:44:47	svenstaro	so let's do no group but separate repos
2020-12-25 09:44:58	Foxboron	ahh

2020-12-25 09:49:05	Foxboron	static is a bit of a misnormer. I think "Conference Resources" makes more sense. or "Conference Files"
2020-12-25 09:49:35	Foxboron	it made sense for the url, not as a repo name :p

2020-12-26 06:46:46	svenstaro	well since we're gonna use gitlab pages it's kinda gonna be the same deal
2020-12-26 06:46:51	svenstaro	but let's start with the git repo
2020-12-26 06:48:20	lahwaacz	svenstaro: uhm, it's Django currently... https://github.com/lahwaacz/archmanweb/

2020-12-26 06:49:07	svenstaro	uh we can't publish it as static? :/
2020-12-26 06:49:43	svenstaro	does it need to be dynamic actually?
2020-12-26 06:49:52	lahwaacz	well not now
2020-12-26 06:50:01	wCPO	wget -r ?
2020-12-26 06:51:14	Foxboron	it was search functionality
2020-12-26 06:51:38	lahwaacz	the search as well as a lot of redirects/symlinks/hardlinks are handled dynamically
2020-12-26 06:52:04	svenstaro	hm I see
2020-12-26 06:52:39	lahwaacz	also a static site would have to be regenerated completely whenever a single package changes
2020-12-26 06:52:43	grawity	is this the online manpage viewer? with the sheer amount of manual pages to render every time, is it actually worth making it static
2020-12-26 06:53:03	wCPO	Hmm, debian manual site is static: https://github.com/Debian/debiman

2020-12-26 06:56:03	lahwaacz	actually the conversion is pretty fast, I think extracting the packages is the bottleneck (and they probably don't measure it)
2020-12-26 06:58:15	wCPO	we could probably make it incremental by (ab)using gitlab artifacts. How much storage does https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/ use?
2020-12-26 06:58:16	phrik	Title: Arch manual pages (at jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz)
2020-12-26 07:01:30	lahwaacz	well the SQL database has several hundred MB, so that's probably not the problem
2020-12-26 07:02:41	lahwaacz	but we'd have to define a new format for the artifacts, rewrite everything from scratch (or from debiman), and we would still not have search
2020-12-26 07:03:08	lahwaacz	there are probably other problems I don't remember...
2020-12-26 07:05:03	wCPO	client-side search is a thing these days, but it sounds like a lot of work and I'm not sure it is worth it..
2020-12-26 07:07:33	svenstaro	prolly not worth it

2020-12-30 21:16:06	thefoxie_	Hey, I guess I got banned as I tried to git push (https unfortunatelly) too many times on aur.archlinux.org as I tried to update package that was orphaned.
2020-12-30 21:19:53	thefoxie_	this should be my (well it's ISP's subnet) IP 188.112.69.212
2020-12-30 21:24:30	grazzolni|M	thefoxie_: yes, you're on the fail2ban jail
2020-12-30 21:27:55	svenstaro	gee our fail2ban is agreessive
2020-12-30 21:28:58	grazzolni|M	svenstaro: not really, he tried to login many times with the wrong user
2020-12-30 21:29:19	thefoxie_	is there some timeout when it disappears or do you have to remove it manually?
2020-12-30 21:29:21	grazzolni|M	thefoxie_: I'm unbaning you, but use the correct user
2020-12-30 21:29:25	svenstaro	just how many times did you log in?
2020-12-30 21:29:35	thefoxie_	yeah I got it now haha
2020-12-30 21:29:38	jelle	thefoxie_: there is a timeout of a day
2020-12-30 21:29:57	grazzolni|M	svenstaro: I've counted 15 on the journal
2020-12-30 21:30:00	thefoxie_	svenstaro: few times probably
2020-12-30 21:30:03	jelle	should maybe document this
2020-12-30 21:30:18	svenstaro	hm well 15 is plenty IMO
2020-12-30 21:30:24	grazzolni|M	svenstaro: yeah.
2020-12-30 21:30:30	thefoxie_	grazzolni|M thanks
2020-12-30 21:30:33	svenstaro	I almost thought it was like 3
2020-12-30 21:30:42	grazzolni|M	anyway, journalctl -g is love
2020-12-30 21:30:47	jelle	hmm it's the default it seems
2020-12-30 21:30:52	grazzolni|M	svenstaro: nah
2020-12-30 21:31:02	svenstaro	but we sometimes got people coming in here because of that
2020-12-30 21:31:11	svenstaro	so maybe it could be raised a lil bit
2020-12-30 21:31:31	svenstaro	does it reset on success?
2020-12-30 21:31:35	jelle	findtime is 15 min, max retry is 5 min
2020-12-30 21:31:41	jelle	ban time is 1 day
2020-12-30 21:32:17	grazzolni|M	thefoxie_: were you able to login now?
2020-12-30 21:37:25	thefoxie_	grazzolni|M: yeah and pushed to AUR but the version stays the same on aurweb 🤔️
2020-12-30 21:38:11	grazzolni|M	thefoxie_: which package?
2020-12-30 21:38:36	thefoxie_	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stoplight-studio-appimage/

2020-12-30 21:39:54	grazzolni|M	I thought the AUR blocked commits without a SRCINFO file
2020-12-30 21:40:02	jelle	grazzolni|M: same :D
2020-12-30 21:40:07	jelle	grazzolni|M: I guess on first commit
2020-12-30 21:40:54	grazzolni|M	jelle: this ain't first commit of that repo either.
2020-12-30 21:41:08	jelle	grazzolni|M: no I mean, only on the first commit
2020-12-30 21:41:43	Foxboron	It's the first commit only, yes.
2020-12-30 21:43:37	grazzolni|M	jelle: you mean first commit of the user?
2020-12-30 21:43:42	jelle	grazzolni|M: yes
2020-12-30 21:44:22	grazzolni|M	Ah, I see. that doesn't make sense though =D
2020-12-30 21:49:12	Foxboron	grazzolni|M: first commit of the package
2020-12-30 21:50:01	grazzolni|M	Foxboron: but that's the thing, this is not the first commit of that package. it might be this user's first commit *on* that package, but not the first overall of the package.
2020-12-30 21:50:51	Foxboron	grazzolni|M: I know? But this is why there is no blocking, only a warning
2020-12-30 21:51:37	grazzolni|M	Foxboron: I distinctly remember the AUR not allowing pushing without a .SRCINFO. but anyway, all's good now
2020-12-30 21:51:48	Foxboron	It's only for the first commit, or the root commit.
