2020-12-21 00:01:33	Hund	sur5r: :D A static one doesn't have any layouts and doesn't automatically resize, move and arrange clients when you spawn or kill clients.
2020-12-21 00:01:58	Hund	Awesome is an example of a dynamic window manager.
2020-12-21 00:02:37	Hund	I just had *another* discussion where someone claims that i3 is a dynamic window manager. This time because it can float clients. :)

2020-12-21 00:31:23	Hund	Anyway. To answer my first question. Is i3 a dynamic window manager or not? The website doesn't mention anything about it being dynamic and I would think that I would have found out about the dynamic features after using it for like 5 years.

2020-12-22 06:39:51	Celmor[m]1	can someone recommend a compositor that works well with i3?
2020-12-22 06:40:55	GermainZ	picom (fork of compton)

2020-12-22 06:52:19	Celmor[m]1	thanks, I'll try that
2020-12-22 06:54:37	GermainZ	and play with its config I guess :p

2020-12-22 06:56:43	Celmor[m]1	I keep having issues with firefox and mpv in particular where only killing compton and optionally restarting helps
2020-12-22 06:56:58	Celmor[m]1	usually after changing xrandr configuration
2020-12-22 06:57:18	GermainZ	Celmor[m]1: what's your config?
2020-12-22 06:57:30	Celmor[m]1	I've just bound xrandr lines to various hotkeys
2020-12-22 06:57:45	Celmor[m]1	or change the display configuration manually using arandr
2020-12-22 06:57:50	Celmor[m]1	so not much of a "configuration"

2020-12-22 06:58:36	Celmor[m]1	is in my i3/config
2020-12-22 06:59:06	GermainZ	well here's my picom.conf if it helps: https://paste.xinu.at/LLPBC/
2020-12-22 06:59:12	Celmor[m]1	have the same line bound to a hotkey which I use after running "killall compton" via drun
2020-12-22 06:59:49	Celmor[m]1	what gpu driver are you using? not sure if I need to change something specific to what I'm using (nvidia)

2020-12-22 07:00:32	GermainZ	I've used both intel and nvidia
2020-12-22 07:00:35	GermainZ	s/intel/mesa/
2020-12-22 07:00:47	Celmor[m]1	with the same config?
2020-12-22 07:00:49	GermainZ	I don't have a 2nd monitor right now (vacation), but it worked fine last week
2020-12-22 07:00:50	GermainZ	yeah
2020-12-22 07:00:56	GermainZ	didn't have the issue you're describing
2020-12-22 07:00:57	Celmor[m]1	alright
2020-12-22 07:01:18	Celmor[m]1	currently firefox refuses to update it's interface after I've rotated my main monitor
2020-12-22 07:01:22	Celmor[m]1	its*
2020-12-22 07:01:34	Celmor[m]1	but still responds to clicks and such
2020-12-22 07:03:00	Celmor[m]1	mpv on the other hand likes to get stuck upon changing my monitor configuration (xrandr hotkey) printing "[2720.124][d][reload] demuxer_cache.transition continue_stuck {"demuxer_cache_time" = 1954.0745, "in_state_time" = 850, "name" = "stuck"}"
2020-12-22 07:03:58	Celmor[m]1	perhaps I'll need to give wayland a try at some point again using "sway"
2020-12-22 07:04:26	GermainZ	with nvidia? Npoe
2020-12-22 07:04:28	GermainZ	Nope * :)
2020-12-22 07:04:52	Celmor[m]1	ok
2020-12-22 07:05:07	Celmor[m]1	right, seem to remember something in that regard

2020-12-24 06:48:38	f3r0x	can anyone tell me how to disable titlebars in i3?
2020-12-24 06:48:48	f3r0x	i have used default border none, to no avail
2020-12-24 06:49:46	amanqa	plitter My slack version is 4.12.0 Slack for Linux
2020-12-24 06:51:48	amanqa	tyjak No, not Nvidia. I have a Dell XPS running Ubuntu 20.04 with Intel UHD graphics 620.
2020-12-24 06:53:24	amanqa	sur5r ah, so then it makes sense that chrome and Slack Desktop -- which is chrome inside -- are both causing these issues.
2020-12-24 06:54:27	kjetilho	amanqa: ah, I have a Dell XPS, too.  it has, in addition to Intel UHD, 01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile] (rev a1)
2020-12-24 06:55:36	kjetilho	that may explain why the Nvidia driver did not work for me :-D  I completely missed that the VGA controller in Intel
2020-12-24 06:56:08	amanqa	Ooh interesting, I didn't realize that was possible. I don't see any reference to NVIDIA when I use lspci
2020-12-24 06:56:30	amanqa	$ lspci -k | grep -iEA5 'vga'
2020-12-24 07:01:02	plitter	have you tried with the nouveau driver instead of the nvidia driver?
