2020-12-19 08:12:37	efrit	wait
2020-12-19 08:13:21	efrit	you declare a foo which takes an int and return 0 as int
2020-12-19 08:13:27	caze	Yes.
2020-12-19 08:13:36	efrit	then you declare a pointer to in (initialized to NULL, as in the first example)

2020-12-19 08:14:28	efrit	then you print the result of foo(*p) to stdout, but you use the %zu for an int
2020-12-19 08:14:44	efrit	so I am not sure if it prints 0, or the size of an int
2020-12-19 08:15:03	caze	efrit: It doesn't get that far.
2020-12-19 08:15:49	efrit	mmh, you call foo with the int pointed by p as argument
2020-12-19 08:16:11	efrit	but since p points to NULL, it doesn’t work?
2020-12-19 08:16:27	caze	Yes, it will typically produce a segfault.
2020-12-19 08:16:41	caze	But then does the first example do the same?

2020-12-19 08:17:20	efrit	I do agree that sizeof is an operator
2020-12-19 08:17:35	caze	efrit: Is there any possible way to write the function foo such that calling the function with *p will not segfault?
2020-12-19 08:18:11	caze	efrit: Yes, sizeof is an operator, and does not require evaluation of the operand, which in this case will produce a segfault.

2020-12-19 08:19:23	efrit	ah yes, you have to use &p

2020-12-19 08:19:37	caze	&*p
2020-12-19 08:19:38	efrit	no it’s p
2020-12-19 08:19:52	caze	tane: It demonstrates that sizeof is not a function. So what reason is there to make it look like a function?
2020-12-19 08:20:07	efrit	caze: because it’s less error-prone?
2020-12-19 08:20:34	wroathe	efrit: It's ultimately a stylistic concern. I would personally argue that any chance to remove extra parenthesis () and curly braces {} results in a cleaner and clearer program.
2020-12-19 08:20:41	tane	it's not more or less error-prone, and that it is possible to not make it look like a function is not a proper argument against it either
2020-12-19 08:20:56	tane	I question the lesson of the whole argument - that sizeof is _not_ a function was clear from the outset
2020-12-19 08:21:15	caze	tane: No it was not.
2020-12-19 08:21:43	caze	tane: efrit said: <efrit> wroathe, that?s true, but I think that, in practice, it?s more convenient to consider sizeof as a function rather than an operator

2020-12-19 08:21:57	tane	yes "consider ... as a function" does imply that it isn't
2020-12-19 08:22:06	wroathe	efrit: And that includes parenthesis that people use to make up for their lack of understanding of the precedence and associativity of operators.
2020-12-19 08:22:22	caze	If you consider sizeof to be a function, then you would consider that int *p = NULL; sizeof(*p); would produce a segfault.
2020-12-19 08:22:30	tane	everyone can write C code of the form f(*x) that doesn't segfault on x == NULL

2020-12-19 08:23:55	efrit	you can remove braces around if it has only a single instruction inside it (and in fact I do it on personal small projects)
2020-12-19 08:23:59	neshpion	i love macros & cheese
2020-12-19 08:24:26	efrit	but in general it’s advised to always use braces after “if” to prevent errors
2020-12-19 08:24:34	neshpion	efrit: people hate it when i do that in open source projects
2020-12-19 08:24:49	caze	efrit: But then f isn't a function. It's a function-like macro. That's not what he was claiming.
2020-12-19 08:24:55	tane	caze, I see your general point, but "X looks like a function but doesn't behave like it in terms of a parameter's null deref" isn't a too convincing argument
2020-12-19 08:24:57	caze	tane: ^
2020-12-19 08:25:37	wroathe	tane: How would you propose to use *x within the macro body so that it doesn't result in a segfault?

2020-12-20 03:37:39	LeoNerd	Ohgod if you're building for AVR you likely don't want to be using printf and stdio. That is one easy way to consume plenty of code space
2020-12-20 03:38:03	LeoNerd	Though I'm surprised you have 16Ki. I can usually get a printf("Hello world") on AVR down to just over 1Ki of actual on-target flash

2020-12-20 03:39:59	LeoNerd	Indeed.. about a kilobyte usually for me. Best to avoid it if you want to save space. Though, honestly; for use in debugging I find having it around is worth the 1Ki of space it eats. Smallest chip I usually target is the ATtiny412, which still has 4Ki of flash
2020-12-20 03:40:07	johnjay	hrm, what's the difference bewteen them then. like oragnizationally
2020-12-20 03:40:08	apotheon	In other words, with regard to those characteristics, as FreeBSD is to Linux-based systems, so OpenBSD is to FreeBSD.
2020-12-20 03:40:13	LeoNerd	If a quarter of that is the printf implementation,... well that still leaves 75% of the chip for real code ;)

2020-12-20 03:44:41	apotheon	I find libsodium promising for some nice portable security stuff, though.  I'll probably use that more in some cases where I'd previously used OpenBSD functions.
2020-12-20 03:45:19	apotheon	As I understand it, libsodium's just wrapping the relevant OpenBSD functions anyway (and FreeBSD or other equivalents, as needed).
2020-12-20 03:45:50	Gaming4JC	yeah. afaik monocypher is good too but not as well documented
2020-12-20 03:46:34	apotheon	Maybe some of it is just a different, portable implementation, but I don't think that's "possible" for the case of things like zeroing a buffer just before freeing.
2020-12-20 03:46:53	apotheon	I'm pretty sure the zero-then-free thing is OS-dependent.

2020-12-20 03:52:00	LeoNerd	Eh.. it's like So Many "optional" bits of C function.. e.g. strdup()
2020-12-20 03:52:20	LeoNerd	Because they're *optional* you can't rely on it being around, so in practice nobody uses it. Since nobody uses it, not everybody bothers to provide it.

2020-12-20 04:14:51	apotheon	It turns out Skynet was a C compiler.
2020-12-20 04:15:02	tuu	apotheon: What about my approach of overwritting with random bytes before writting to the file?

2020-12-20 04:15:48	tuu	I guess a very smart compiler might even notice that and then write them to the file directly instead using the array damn it
2020-12-20 04:15:59	expert975	reuse the buffer instead of freeing it

2020-12-20 04:16:10	apotheon	You might get some issues with text length inference, but the bigger problem for many would be performance issues.
2020-12-20 04:16:31	apotheon	You don't want to write useless data to a file when performance matters at all.  I/O is expensive.
2020-12-20 04:16:47	apotheon	Making it random data actually increases the performance penalty quite a bit, too.
2020-12-20 04:17:08	apotheon	expert975: That's a limited use case.  Sometime, the buffer in question is the last buffer you need.

2020-12-20 04:17:37	expert975	apotheon: you can do the expensive thing only on the last buffer
2020-12-20 04:18:02	tuu	apotheon: Isn't it often that keys are erased after being used at the end?
2020-12-20 04:18:04	apotheon	expert975: There are cases where that's not something you want at the end of the program run, though.
2020-12-20 04:18:11	tuu	In that case performance impact might not matter anymore..

2020-12-20 04:18:36	apotheon	tuu: I'm of the "avoid premature optimization" camp, but we still need a better/faster way to do it than that for the cases where performance matters.

2020-12-20 04:19:52	tuu	But also there are cases where security might matter more, so in that cases a portable but slow solution might be better, where in that case that would probably be -O0
2020-12-20 04:20:10	apotheon	For instance, when writing portable code, the result may be that it gets run on a system that doesn't effectively protect your data left in a buffer when freed.

2020-12-20 04:20:47	apotheon	It can be done.  It just *isn't*.
2020-12-20 04:20:59	apotheon	q.v. C11's optional extensions
2020-12-20 04:21:19	tuu	I admit my first thoughts on this were quite naive..
2020-12-20 04:21:37	apotheon	Mine too, back when I first started looking into it.
2020-12-20 04:22:06	apotheon	Luckily, I learned about the problem between writing naive code and releasing anything significant that used that code.

2020-12-20 04:25:34	tuu	I guess there would have to be a mechanism specifically for sensitive data..

Every resource out there says that if you do (double) (start - end) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC where start and end are clock() return values, that you get something that can be measured in seconds. But I get something that is off by -10^2. I would need to multiply the result of that formula by x100 to get seconds. Am I
2020-12-20 22:42:25	sgibber2018	missing something? Is that normal?

2020-12-20 23:10:37	dave0	real time here means like a wall clock or a stopwatch.. cpu time is how much time is spent executing your code. sleep does not take up cpu time because the scheduler does not run your program while your program is sleeping

2020-12-20 23:13:20	Wulf	sgibber2018: if your goal is a fixed frame rate (e.g. 60 fps), CPU time isn't useful to you. If you want to limit the frame rate so your program will use ~ 50% cpu, then clock() could be useful for you.
2020-12-20 23:13:24	sgibber2018	In this case I'm not using sleep though. I understand that processor time is the amount of processor "ticks" since program execution began
2020-12-20 23:14:20	Wulf	sgibber2018: only the number of "ticks" it spends working on your program.
2020-12-20 23:15:13	dave0	sgibber2018: sleep, nanosleep, usleep, nap, delay ... these all pause your program but take no cpu time
2020-12-20 23:15:50	dave0	it's a feature of multitasking OS's... if you were dos, you'd just burn cycles in a busy loop for a delay
2020-12-20 23:16:15	sgibber2018	Wulf: I wound up hard-coding a 30FPS framerate with nanosleep which works fine. I am just trying to understand my misconception here about how Clock() and CLOCKS_PER_SEC work. I feel like I must be making some very basic mistake. Here is an example program where I'm trying to keep a running "counter" of seconds using the CLOCKS_PER_SEC conversion. https://paste.debian.net/hidden/71badea9/

I arrived at this file https://repo.or.cz/nvi.git/blob/HEAD:/vi/v_txt.c. Looks like v_tcmd() is called, it sets some flags, and stores some state and calls v_txt(). v_txt() looks like a generic function being calld by and used in all input situations in nvi wheather it is a ":" command or "i", "o", "a" or
2020-12-20 23:40:21	pyzozord	others. So then I decided to study the v_txt(), and I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of code and how obscure it is. Do you guys have any advices on how understand this (or any complex/terse/obscure) code better and faster?

2020-12-20 23:57:53	Xgc	pyzozord: In many cases, up to date comments can help.  v_txt isn't commented well, so you are expected to know its purpose or derive its purpose as you read it.  Many authors don't initially write code with other readers in mind.  Trying to correct that later isn't usually successful.

2020-12-21 00:07:15	Xgc	pyzozord: It's commented.  But the details on individual statements or statement blocks are much more detailed than some of the top level function comments on the purpose of the function.

2020-12-21 00:08:01	luckyxxl	xuxx: given the callstack you can see that it's a pthread-internal allocation that's leaking. when you're sure that the semaphore is closed correctly it can still be that valgrind can't correctly detect a corresponding free, or that pthread is keeping a list of whatever mappings around which it does not free on exit, but relies on the os to do that.
2020-12-21 00:08:11	Xgc	pyzozord: You're left with having to derive the purpose of that function from calls and some of the partial comments within the function.

2020-12-21 00:10:07	Xgc	pyzozord: The author already has a complete understanding of the purpose of v_txt.  He just needed to capture detail about specific lines/sections to help refresh his memory.

2020-12-21 00:13:23	TheBeastie	in the function free_elem_t() you free() the pointers that you passed as parameters to new_elem_t() this is a mistake... you don't know if the pointers you passed to the allocation routine came from an allocation themselves.

2020-12-21 00:34:33	pyzozord	TheBeastie: I mean I think I get it, it's a function that handles "user input" in vi, so any time you type on your keyboard and text appears on the screen. Surprisingly that includes "i" insert mode and the ":" command mode. My goal is to replace normal handling of ":" command mode with readline. So I don't care what this function does outside of the fact that I need to make readline() be kind of compatible

2020-12-21 03:06:08	Akuli	what's the bot command for showing the malloc pattern?
2020-12-21 03:06:13	Akuli	!malloc
2020-12-21 03:06:13	candide	There is no need to cast the result of library functions that return void *; it makes your code hard to read, adds no value, and can hide a bug if you don't have a valid prototype in scope. See http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
2020-12-21 03:06:20	Akuli	hmm, not quite
2020-12-21 03:06:24	Akuli	!mallocidiom
2020-12-21 03:06:25	candide	T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is a much more robust idiom than T *p = malloc(sizeof (T)) because there is no chance of the sizeof (T) failing to match up with the T that was used to declare p. It's also more concise and easier to read.
2020-12-21 03:06:26	Akuli	there :D
2020-12-21 03:06:30	maslen	oh, I see: I think it's referencing the variable, as opposed to the type. Since the variable is a pointer, it's saying "dereference the pointer, so that it's sizeof the object, as opposed to the pointer type" ?
2020-12-21 03:06:40	Akuli	right

2020-12-22 07:49:53	twkm	before we decided that every bit must be usable as part of the value (2's complement) there were indeed such things, "trap" values, the equivalent to a nan for integers.
2020-12-22 07:50:16	apotheon	Okay, wait, I think the theme emerges.  It might make *some* sense, given that (int)variable_containing_nan actually produces an integer.
2020-12-22 07:50:38	twkm	whether they actually trapped or not was platform spectific, similar to whether a nan is signalling or not.

2020-12-22 13:57:34	vejetaryenvampir	There is a switch (nearly very sharp) from prefering prefix increment to prefering postfix increment when they produce the same result, in the book The C Prgogramming Language (2nd edition).  It happens after around chapter 3.  Does anyone know something about it?  I *know* what they are, what they possibly do; I just want to learn what is the cause of the change.  Like maybe one writer wrote the first
2020-12-22 13:57:36	vejetaryenvampir	couple chapters and other writer did the other part and they had different preferrances.  Or maybe it is that, but thi first writer then follows the second writer's style for the sake of style compatibility?  Thank you!

2020-12-22 16:55:01	TheBeastie	hmmm.... not.... what lexer are you using, flex?
2020-12-22 16:55:17	ajn43	lex
2020-12-22 16:55:40	TheBeastie	the old lex?  you mean at&t lex?
2020-12-22 16:56:12	TheBeastie	I don't think so... that should mean you are using something as SCO UNIX or the like.
2020-12-22 16:56:13	ajn43	\/usr/bin/lex i think its the standard
2020-12-22 16:56:26	TheBeastie	hmm.... one second.

2020-12-22 16:56:55	TheBeastie	so you are using GNU flex

2020-12-22 16:57:48	TheBeastie	well... read the flex info (it's a bit complicated to parse a string)  you need to cope with the buffering macros flex uses to scan the input.
2020-12-22 16:58:31	ajn43	i see, so the simplest way would be to read from a file's in stream huh?
2020-12-22 16:58:33	TheBeastie	the original lex based the buffered input in stdio package.... but flex has a different approach (that allows you to substitute the buffer by a plain string)

2020-12-22 22:07:40	d3x0r	mendax gtk is standard to use - there's certainly lots of examples ; https://github.com/d3x0r/sack has a gui layer too that works on many platforms that I think is easy... create a dialogframe, EditFrame( frame, TRUE) ; enables buitin editor that saves the resulting format as an XML that can be reloaded
2020-12-22 22:07:54	d3x0r	or if the XML doesn't exist, show a default, save that, and reload later with new configs
2020-12-22 22:08:35	d3x0r	but probably requires work to actually setup that I take for granted, because there are so many options, sometimes the defaults aren't exactly right (esp. on linux)

2020-12-23 13:58:10	wroathe	apteryx: So it can be a source of bugs... but to some extent that's just the nature of the beast when dealing with arrays
2020-12-23 13:58:37	apteryx	ah! So it's scanning the memory until the pointer progresses to the end, which is assumed to be \0 and exits on this (since it's false).
2020-12-23 13:59:04	wroathe	apteryx: Well, if it's an array of strings the last element would technically be a NULL, not a \0
2020-12-23 13:59:13	wroathe	apteryx: But it's all 0
2020-12-23 14:00:00	wroathe	apteryx: But yes, you get the gist
2020-12-23 14:00:19	apteryx	OK! So I don't need to know the size of an array to use it with a for loop, assuming I ensure it's NULL terminated.
2020-12-23 14:00:35	wroathe	apteryx: Yup. That's the primary use call for a NULL terminated array

2020-12-23 14:18:07	nitrix	You have to explicitly pass the count of elements around. The size can be inferred from the type of the element * the number of elements.
2020-12-23 14:18:45	apteryx	nitrix: so instead of returning an array, that function would need to return for example a struct that contains the count of elements + the array itself, correct?
2020-12-23 14:19:33	nitrix	apteryx, Yes, or more commonly, take an pointer to an array and a pointer to a size_t as parameters.
2020-12-23 14:20:21	nitrix	The data is "returned" by writing to the objects pointed to by the pointer and the function normally returns an int to say whether it was successful or not.
2020-12-23 14:20:47	apteryx	I see! That seems more idiomatic to C indeed.
2020-12-23 14:20:52	apteryx	thanks
2020-12-23 14:20:58	nitrix	There are variations in-between. Like read writes to a buffer received as parameter, but returns the number of bytes written directly.
2020-12-23 14:21:08	nitrix	read() that is.
2020-12-23 14:22:18	nitrix	There's one last technique but it's a bit more advanced and has very rare use cases...
2020-12-23 14:22:23	wroathe	apteryx: You've touched upon one of the main pain points of dealing with arrays in C. You'll find lots and lots and lots of functions with parameters that are just the count of elements in the array parameter before or after it
2020-12-23 14:23:53	nitrix	That last technique is a custom allocation function that over-allocate storage when you ask for an array. It then stores in the first few bytes an integer with the number of elements and returns a pointer to the memory just after the integer.

2020-12-23 14:25:04	nitrix	That's known as a "fat pointer", where you're able to pass the pointer around, use it completely normally, and for libraries that knows the little secret, they're able to look at the data before the pointer's address to obtain the element counts when it needs it.

2020-12-23 14:29:17	nitrix	Antirez's (redis's author) for a reference implementation: https://github.com/antirez/sds
2020-12-23 14:30:38	nitrix	You obviously cannot free it normally though, as the pointer doesn't actually pointer at the beginning of the allocated object, so you need a custom deallocator too.
2020-12-23 14:31:42	wroathe	While this is fancy, I probably wouldn't reach for it for run-of-the-mill array handling
2020-12-23 14:32:05	wroathe	But it's certainly worth mentioning
2020-12-23 14:32:09	nitrix	That's all the techniques I know of. (1) The sentinel/terminator value. (2) The API returning things via parameters. (3) Explicitly passing sizes around. (4) Implicitly passing sizes around (fat pointers).

2020-12-24 06:26:10	computerquip	In C, they're just... functions that are in a library.

2020-12-24 06:31:29	wroathe	I've always thought it reasonable to refer to anything that your compiler and your language's standard library provide as a primitive.

2020-12-24 06:32:33	apotheon	I guess "primitive functions" works for things that deal with language/type primitives, but the question then arises:
2020-12-24 06:32:44	computerquip	I'm not sure C or C++ as a standard define "primitive". But I was taught that things like char and int are primitive types.
2020-12-24 06:32:47	apotheon	. . . do third-party library functions that do that count as "primitive" functions?
2020-12-24 06:33:03	apteryx	The Guile Reference manual says about primitives: "A primitive is a procedure that, when compiled, may be open-coded. For example, ‘cons’ is usually recognized as a primitive, so that it compiles down to a single instruction.".  From this definition it doesn't seem to have grounds in C?
2020-12-24 06:33:29	apotheon	Yes, char and int are what I'd consider primitive types, which is why I think (for instance) something that is specifically an int-operation function might reasonably be considered a "primitive function".
2020-12-24 06:33:33	computerquip	memcpy can be optimized away
2020-12-24 06:33:40	computerquip	Would that fall into that definition?
2020-12-24 06:33:45	wroathe	But really it's a relative term. If your application relies heavily on a 3rd party library that provides the foundation for what you're doing, then you'd consider the API that that library provides to be "primitives" that your application depends on.
2020-12-24 06:34:14	apotheon	apteryx: The Guile reference manual is written by GNU people, so I'm skeptical of that as a standard for how to define "primitive".
2020-12-24 06:34:49	Acacia	I fail at this all the time too but when programming C it's best to stick to C terminology
2020-12-24 06:35:00	apotheon	wroathe: I was under the impression we're really talking about something that could in some sense be considered a *language* primitive, not just a "project problem domain" primitive.
2020-12-24 06:35:02	 *	wroathe rolls eyes
2020-12-24 06:35:23	pragma-	imagine having to constantly change your vocabulary depending on which programming language you're using and how horribly it has overloaded or co-opted various terms.
2020-12-24 06:35:27	pragma-	horrible.
2020-12-24 06:35:30	wroathe	apotheon: I don't think there's much value in defining a difference when the language standard doesn't formally define what it means
2020-12-24 06:35:50	wroathe	apotheon: I tend to use "primitive" informally
2020-12-24 06:36:08	apotheon	Anyway, for the kind of thing that (lacking context) I would assume about what someone means by "primitive function" by comparison with the same term in other languages, I'd think we're better off in C referring to "standard" functions, meaning functions implemented from international standards.
2020-12-24 06:36:24	apotheon	The only question, then, is what standards we consider relevant to the generic case in C.
2020-12-24 06:36:29	computerquip	pragma-, I can't tell if you're making fun of C or not
2020-12-24 06:36:35	computerquip	C++ is even worse with that

2020-12-24 06:38:14	apotheon	"block" has special meaning in some languages, while it's just a more general organizational term for most; "function" has special meaning in some languages (e.g. Haskell or Python), while it's just a more general term in some languages (e.g. C) . . .

2020-12-24 06:41:15	apotheon	. . . but C uses block in a general sense, and Smalltalk in a very specific sense, for instance
2020-12-24 06:41:44	apotheon	Thus, from one language to another, I get to encounter what pragma- was talking about constantly.
2020-12-24 06:41:52	apotheon	Show me a language that doesn't change the definitions.
2020-12-24 06:42:39	computerquip	I've always considered block a lexical term in C, a "block" of statements.
2020-12-24 06:42:55	caze	It is.
2020-12-24 06:42:57	wroathe	apotheon: Block is defined at length in the C standard.
2020-12-24 06:43:44	apotheon	In Smalltalk a block is a particular syntactic construct whose underlying semantic form is essentially a function interface for a one-off callback.

2020-12-25 08:39:02	meandrain	yeah, indeed, it works
2020-12-25 08:40:34	meandrain	in FreeBSD it works with Lstr using %s, and not %ls but I don't know if the printed character is the right one
2020-12-25 08:40:56	wroathe	meandrain: The printed characters should be identical to the string literal you see in the program text
2020-12-25 08:40:59	meandrain	well it's not, it's printing something else

2020-12-25 10:37:41	vdamewood	kororaa: With something other than a mac. -- Sent from my MacBook Pro.
2020-12-25 10:37:54	kororaa	i've tried graphics.h and opengl
2020-12-25 10:37:56	dave0	kororaa: www.libsdl.org
2020-12-25 10:38:14	kororaa	thanks dave0 :D
2020-12-25 10:38:38	vdamewood	Oh yeah, SDL works for 2D-graphics.
2020-12-25 10:39:06	kororaa	i just want 2d
2020-12-25 10:40:10	vdamewood	kororaa: Oh, okay. SDL is great then. OpenGL is used for 3D and is being replaced by Metal on Macs and iThings, DirectX on Windows, and Vulkan on other systems, none of which provide C interfaces.
2020-12-25 10:41:03	kororaa	thx

2020-12-25 10:48:35	sgibber2018	I bought a book on SDL like a year ago and I'm going to dive into it this weekend. I'm pretty stoked :D
2020-12-25 10:48:44	sgibber2018	Been waiting eagerly for the right moment
2020-12-25 10:49:42	kororaa	what will you make?
2020-12-25 10:50:16	sgibber2018	First thing I'll probably do is translate my ncurses tetris game to it.
2020-12-25 10:50:49	sgibber2018	But I have been wanting to make a generic 2-D engine for a long, long time. It's more about the engine than the games but I plan to make all kinds of simple games.
2020-12-25 10:51:37	kororaa	i want to make daisyworld
2020-12-25 10:51:43	nitrix-mas	2D SDL are pretty simple. You load your tileset image into a texture, then write your game engine to rectangle draws of regions of the texture onto regions of the screen.
2020-12-25 10:51:46	vdamewood	This gives me an idea that I'll probably never do. An SDL-based library with a curses-compatible API.
2020-12-25 10:52:04	nitrix-mas	It does not much else for you other than windowing, inputs and drawing.
2020-12-25 10:52:04	sgibber2018	kororaa: What's daisyworld?
2020-12-25 10:52:57	sgibber2018	nitrix-mas: That sounds perfect. The kinds of things I want to make are mostly in the same vein as SNES games.
2020-12-25 10:53:22	vdamewood	SDL doesn't do mode 7, though.
2020-12-25 10:53:27	kororaa	a basic ecosystem simulation
2020-12-25 10:54:11	sgibber2018	vdamewood: Mode 7 is a little beyond anything I'm capable of attempting right now, but that will be something to try and overcome when I get there. :D
2020-12-25 10:54:24	kororaa	a planet covered in reflective daisies and absorptive daisies that attempt to regulate the planet's temperature as the sun gradually heats up
2020-12-25 10:54:56	sgibber2018	kororaa: That sounds pretty awesome!

2020-12-25 10:55:05	candide	Title of kororaa's link: Daisyworld: a tutorial approach to geophysiological modelling
2020-12-25 10:55:10	vdamewood	sgibber2018: It really shouldn't be too hard with SDL. SDL just doesn't have the primitives for it.
2020-12-25 10:55:33	vdamewood	sgibber2018: It's really just streaching/skewing a background
2020-12-25 10:55:52	sgibber2018	vdamewood: Challenge accepted >.> I'll let you know in a few months if I can pull off some Mario Kart shenanigans
2020-12-25 10:57:37	sgibber2018	The book I bought is based around SDL 1.2 from 2015, but I'm hoping it mostly translates to modern SDL.

2020-12-25 11:10:39	sgibber2018	vdamewood: Well that's weird. It is a textbook that would have been used in some elective classes.
2020-12-25 11:10:45	vdamewood	(The last release of SDL 1.2, and the first of SDL 2.0 were released in 2013.)
2020-12-25 11:11:12	nitrix-mas	SDL 1.2 is very different. It's based around SDL_Surface instead of the hardware-accelerated SDL_Texture.
2020-12-25 11:11:20	Terlisimo	http://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide
2020-12-25 11:11:40	Terlisimo	^^ 1.2 to 2.0
2020-12-25 11:11:45	vdamewood	sgibber2018: I *think* SDL 1.2 was still 'supported' for a while after 2.0 was released. But it was mature and stable enough that they didn't need any more bug fixes.

2020-12-26 06:24:15	Acacia	tuu: I think it's correct now
2020-12-26 06:24:21	tuu	I interpreted "the total length of the string they tried to create." as refering to the destination string..

2020-12-26 06:24:46	cousteau	I've seen descriptions of TRNGs based on flip flops with race conditions
2020-12-26 06:25:05	Acacia	the next sentence also says "For strlcpy() that means the length of src."
2020-12-26 06:25:58	cousteau	like, you have 2 circuits that generate a pulse simultaneously, and an RS FF that will get set to 0 if the 1st circuit fires first, and 1 if the 2nd one does
2020-12-26 06:26:09	tuu	Apparently I didn't read carefully enough.

2020-12-26 07:04:09	unclechu	hey. i’m trying do work with sockets. in my particular case server only writes something to the socket but never reads from it.
2020-12-26 07:04:09	unclechu	is it okay to just do `accept` and never `read`? or i could mark the socket as write-only somehow?
2020-12-26 07:04:41	unclechu	can this be that a client could write something and it would stuck in a buffer? can anything go wrong in this case?

2020-12-26 07:16:38	nitrix-mas	Not much will go wrong. If the client sends data, the driver's buffer will fill up until it is full, at which points, further incoming packets will get dropped.
2020-12-26 07:17:33	nitrix-mas	If this is TCP/IP, that means they don't get acknowledged, meaning gradually due to nagle's algorithm, the sender's upload will slow to a crawl.

2020-12-26 09:19:54	nitrix-mas	wroathe, __STDC_VERSION__ is 201112 and __STDC_NO_THREADS__ is undefined.
2020-12-26 09:20:15	nitrix-mas	Which means it's supposed to have the threads.h header but it doesn't.
2020-12-26 09:21:03	nitrix-mas	I'm more inclined to think that some library somewhere (glibc maybe?) isn't compliant. It's supposed to define __STDC_NO_THREADS__ to be 1 in that case.

According to section 6.5.8, if I have a char *a and a char *b, then the expression "a < b" is undefined behavior according to section 6.5.8. However, it only says that about relational operators. So I'm reading section 6.5.9 and trying to

2020-12-27 09:11:19	nitrix	C11 6.5.9p6 answers the same thing that C11 6.5.8p5 does with regard to comparing pointers to different objects, except that the wording is about comparing equal, rather than comparing greater or lesser than.

2020-12-27 09:12:40	kurahaupo	Acacia: relational operators are always undefined when pointers into different arrays are involved, but for equality operators, they're guaranteed to be false except when a one-past-end pointer is involved, or when one is a subobject of the other.
2020-12-27 09:13:23	nitrix	Interestingly, it uses `if and only if` as logical implication. So it's either true or false, not undefined.

2020-12-27 09:46:39	kkd	Acacia: another thing, one-past-end comparing equal to the pointer to another object does not quite work on GCC (even though the C standard guarantees it if it can be established that the other object follows the first one in memory). clang does not miscompile that case anymore though (in C mode), so TLDR you might want to avoid relying on something like that even though the object layout is fixed
2020-12-27 09:47:51	kkd	https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61502#c3 is relevant. moreover the general feeling is to probably give up this guarantee in the future, C++ also chose to make the computation have an unspecified result in one of the recent revisions.

2020-12-30 21:22:28	dave0	pyzozord: you should be able to compile ncurses and readline in your home directory and have your program link to them (rather than the systems) with -L/home/pyzozord/ncurses/lib and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime
2020-12-30 21:23:01	dave0	pyzozord: that would be a lot of extra work
2020-12-30 21:23:04	ski	because you're passing `next_letter' recursively to `alphabet', which will then call (a pointer to the first element of) it `letter' in the recursive call, and then proceed to call `strcat' on it, which assumes it has enough storage for the trailing characters to be written to the end of it

2020-12-30 21:37:14	candide	It had been 27 days and 13 hours since someone gibbered some nonsense about arrays "decaying" to pointers (see !decay).
2020-12-30 21:37:18	ski	you can't pass arrays as parameters, or return them from, functions. (although you could pass or return a `struct' that includes an array ..)
2020-12-30 21:37:43	brownbrown	and you should never pass a struct only pointers to struct
2020-12-30 21:38:04	ski	in most contexts, when you refer to an array, it will implicitly get converted to a pointer to its first element. (exceptions include using `sizeof', and using `&', on it)

2020-12-31 09:26:46	superleaf1995	Well the point is, if i cast a 64-bits into a 32-bit what does gcc do with the left 32-bits?, does it just grabs the lower of higher

2020-12-31 09:27:14	superleaf1995	what
2020-12-31 09:27:42	superleaf1995	the int is 64 bits, then calls a function which requries 64 bits, and another which requires the 32 bits

2020-12-31 09:27:59	superleaf1995	in this case the int is a `unsigned long long`
2020-12-31 09:28:04	nitrix	GCC doesn't "do" anything with it, you'll just observe whatever the platform targeted by GCC happens to exhibit.

2020-12-31 09:36:56	nitrix	C already has well-defined pointer arithmetic.
2020-12-31 09:40:42	nitrix	Sometimes you have to convert to `char *` when you're playing with effective types, but definitely not an integer.
2020-12-31 09:41:34	superleaf1995	Look, it's a `void *`, then its passed to a function as a `uint64_t`, then passed to another function as `uint32_t`
2020-12-31 09:41:44	superleaf1995	the original question was: what does gcc do
2020-12-31 09:41:56	superleaf1995	does it uses the lower or higher bits for the `uint32_t` cast?

2020-12-31 09:45:55	nitrix	Thedarkb-Desktop, C11 6.3.2.3p7 lets you convert any object pointer type to any other object pointer type, then back, and the result is guaranteed to compare equal to the original pointer.
2020-12-31 09:46:12	nitrix	Thedarkb-Desktop, So in this sense, I think their `char *` acts like a glorified `void *`.

2020-12-31 09:52:44	wroathe	I'm fairly certain the license for the source code of a language and the source code that one writes with that language are two distinct things
2020-12-31 09:53:10	wroathe	Unless they've explicitly stated that all code written with the new language is covered by their license, that is

2020-12-31 09:54:27	apotheon	A compiler being GPLv3 doesn't necessarily matter, all by itself, but core libs do.
2020-12-31 09:56:31	mertyildiran	apotheon: the core libraries are always dynamically linked, I don't think that means any program written in Chaos, automatically shares the license of those shared objects.

2020-12-31 09:58:10	apotheon	Is this purely an interpreted language, then?
2020-12-31 09:58:32	apotheon	Of course, that makes no difference to the question of whether the library licenses change the program license.
2020-12-31 09:58:52	mertyildiran	apotheon: no it's also compiled. It compiles to an intermediate C code.
2020-12-31 10:01:05	apotheon	The original reason for the difference between GPL and LGPL is for library use without affecting the license of the program that uses the libraries.  That's because depending on GPLed libraries makes the whole program subject to the GPL.

2020-12-31 10:23:42	wroathe	mertyildiran: Just pick a different license that says what you want it to say
2020-12-31 10:23:56	apotheon	oldlaptop: Yeah, there's the FSF position that it does, and LGPL doesn't; there are outsiders who say GPL doesn't cross dynamic linking; and there are other outsiders who say LGPL *does* cross dynamic linking.
2020-12-31 10:24:31	wroathe	and that conversation I had about license covering source code and object code was with oldlaptop, funny enough
2020-12-31 10:24:33	apotheon	In general, though, it looks like GPL does and LGPL doesn't, based on my best analysis of the terms of these licenses.
2020-12-31 10:24:37	wroathe	oldlaptop: It's like I summoned you here :P
2020-12-31 10:24:46	apotheon	I am not a lawyer.  Don't take this as legal advice.

2020-12-31 10:25:36	oldlaptop	My spidey sense says a judge would probably focus on the fact that people tend to expect and acknowledge that GPL attaches across dynamic linking. (That's worth approximately nothing.)
2020-12-31 10:25:42	apotheon	Don't sue me if you do something dumb in court based on what I said as a statement of opinion.

2020-12-31 10:26:38	apotheon	oldlaptop: Yeah, the intent of the licensor and reasonable (for some definition of reasonable) expectation of the recipient factor into it, assuming competent lawyers on all sides.
2020-12-31 10:27:46	apotheon	Keep in mind that reasonable expectation also gives rise to crap like recording artists losing court cases over songwriting credits because of a four-note phrase that is similar to something that went viral on YouTube.
2020-12-31 10:28:31	wroathe	mertyildiran: This compiler calls the C generated "intermediate". Does that mean you have a module that converts the generated C to low level representation? Or does your compiler just output C?
2020-12-31 10:28:33	mertyildiran	wroathe: I've briefly look at the licenses of Python and PHP before deciding the GPLv3 license for Chaos. They have their own both BSD-style, GPL compatible but not copyleft custom licenses. Since I'm unable to write a custom license or understand the legal terminology, I went with GPLv3 without much thinking.
2020-12-31 10:29:55	mertyildiran	wroathe: compiler just outputs C but for compilation to machine code, a portion of the language's source is statically linked. Therefore it can cause troubles in case of GPLv3 that I can see now.
2020-12-31 10:29:55	oldlaptop	You could just take one of their licenses, or one of the more common BSD-style licenses.
2020-12-31 10:30:00	apotheon	mertyildiran: Are you specifically looking for a copyleft license?
2020-12-31 10:30:15	Acacia	because I don't understand legal terminology, I go with short licenses that I can understand and more importantly that are short enough that I can be made to read them

2020-12-31 10:30:29	apotheon	Statically linked language source is definitely a problem in this case.
2020-12-31 10:30:34	wroathe	(From a licensing standpoint, that is)

2020-12-31 10:31:22	wroathe	Acacia: I just paste the itunes terms and conditions into a LICENSE file and hope no one notices.
2020-12-31 10:31:25	apotheon	wroathe: You're not a court, so your very reasonable assumptions about the relationship between source and object unfortunately doesn't mean much.
2020-12-31 10:31:46	apotheon	wroathe: Copyright crosses the boundary between sheet music and a performance, after all.

2020-12-31 10:34:13	nitrix	Acacia, I use the UNLICENSE license, which is public domain anywhere applicable. I think licenses and patents falls into the unproductive bureaucracy that already waste too much of everyone's time.
2020-12-31 10:35:18	Acacia	yeah, if this patent/copyright made sense at some point which I still doubt that point certainly isn't now
2020-12-31 10:35:19	apotheon	Ideally, something like Unlicense would be very low-stress, but in practice the treatment of the public domain across jurisdictions causes problems, so I don't usually got that route.
2020-12-31 10:35:30	nitrix	Acacia, People that actually want to solve a problem will solve the problem, people that actually want to contribute to humanity will contribute, artists that want to express themselves will express themselves, discoveries are discoveries (you don't own what you discover), inventions are meaningless unless you put the work to turn it into a product, so on.
2020-12-31 10:36:14	apotheon	If I want to release something into the public domain, I instead use a license that approximates it as much as possible, because of these international issues with the public domain.
2020-12-31 10:36:42	wroathe	I just use the MIT license

2020-12-31 10:37:42	Acacia	the way I look at it, today's inventions are derived from a combination of other inventions and using other inventions as tools, so by prohibiting free sharing of inventions then we disencourage inventions. "protecting inventors to encourage invention" is a common reasoning for copyright/patent law
2020-12-31 10:38:23	wroathe	I've always understood GPL to generally be a form of "activist" license for people that have a problem with profiting off of software.
2020-12-31 10:38:32	Acacia	there's also the issue of production, if more people can produce then there's more competition in the market, and these copyright/patent laws can prohibit people from producing
