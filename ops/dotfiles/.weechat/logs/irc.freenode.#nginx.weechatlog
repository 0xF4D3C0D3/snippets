2020-12-22 06:52:43	daf19	I'm using nginx for websocket proxying to a jetty server on the same box.  It's a situation where I need the max-idle-time for clients to be infinite: clients stay connected and receive data from the server until they decide to close the connection.

2020-12-22 07:10:15	questionmarkking	bit og a weird question with a few caveats. I have an nginx host that handles ssl translation, load balancing with two upstreams, etc. However, I need to redirect requests for /path1 to a separate backend host that is already running https right now, another kicker is that the SSL cert already running on that host I need to redirect to will be a mistmatch because of resolution issues within the
2020-12-22 07:10:17	questionmarkking	environment. Any way to set up location block for an existing https upstream that will also have a cert mismatch/ignore the mismatch?
2020-12-22 07:11:49	questionmarkking	I've tried using prox_ssl_server_name on; and just using the IP as the upstream server in that block.

2020-12-22 07:13:36	questionmarkking	backstory is basically we have an old site with some resources we still need access to temporarily in /path1, which is why using the public name won't work anymore b/c that directs to newly launched site.

2020-12-22 07:16:46	MTecknology	It sounds like your question is less about nginx and more about figuring out what it is you should be trying to accomplish.
2020-12-22 07:17:07	questionmarkking	well, my intial question is still about nginx.
2020-12-22 07:17:32	questionmarkking	can you send to an upstream that is already on https with a cert mismatch?
2020-12-22 07:17:38	MTecknology	Yeah... and I'm sure it's somewhere in that wall of text.
2020-12-22 07:18:14	questionmarkking	Ah yes, "not enough detail" vs "wall of text", a classic.
2020-12-22 07:18:23	MTecknology	What's the point of a cert if you plan to ignore mismatches?

2020-12-22 07:48:15	alex88	since the cdn sends the original Host in another header, can i somehow make nginx swap the header with the Host it uses for redirects etc?

2020-12-22 07:52:23	Peng	"return 301 http://$http_some_header/foo;"? But you would want to verify that the header couldn't be spoofed
2020-12-22 07:53:14	alex88	well we don't get any requests outside the CDN servers so that header should always be set by the cdn
2020-12-22 07:53:26	alex88	but that might be an idea thanks :)
2020-12-22 07:53:46	alex88	or we can just set a cdn rule to always set that even if the client doesn't send it
2020-12-22 07:53:58	alex88	so we should be safe

2020-12-22 15:46:44	deksar	Hello everyone. What would you suggest for the best nginx performance? A CPU with 4 c / 8 t - 4.2 GHz / 4.5 GHz (turbo) - or a CPU with: 4 c / 8 t - 4 GHz / 4.9 GHz. More cores/threads or much faster core clock speed?
2020-12-22 15:49:17	kerframil	neither has more cores/threads than the other, though?
2020-12-22 15:49:44	deksar	Sorry my bad. It is 28 c / 56 t - 2.6 GHz / 3.7 GHz vs 4 c / 8 t - 4 GHz / 4.9 GHz
2020-12-22 15:50:02	kerframil	in any case, if anything renders you CPU bound, it's almost certainly not going to be nginx. that's something to keep in mind.

2020-12-22 15:56:01	kerframil	just as an example, say you execute long-running, single-core burning PHP programs but with a low degree of concurrency, then the second CPU might serve you better. yet, the first one obviously gives you far more aggregate power and will scale much further.
2020-12-22 15:58:21	kerframil	it's not just about clock speeds either. newer generation cores have IPC improvements and may be less adversely affected by security mitigations in view of the meltdown and spectre fiascos.
2020-12-22 15:58:22	FinalX	deksar: Xeon vs Core i makes a difference in being able to execute tasks in parallel faster, but neither will probably matter for your usecase.
2020-12-22 15:58:43	kerframil	and Xeons have more cache etc.
2020-12-22 15:59:11	FinalX	deksar: I manage nginx loadbalancers for tens of thousands of websites, with 3000 lines of self-programmed Lua-code, and still it can reach over a million requests per second in benchmarks.
2020-12-22 15:59:24	FinalX	Meanwhile the whole cluster does like 400 requests per second, tops.
2020-12-22 15:59:27	kerframil	indeed. nginx itself is peanuts.
2020-12-22 15:59:51	kerframil	owing in no small part to its astonishing efficiency.
2020-12-22 16:03:58	FinalX	I think that for this purpose (load balancing for tens of thousands of sites with the Lua-code and sending it off to different backends) I could probably get away with running nginx on a Raspberry Pi tbh.
2020-12-22 16:05:00	FinalX	Though the Lua-stuff is eating some memory. Still, that fits in 4GB total :)
2020-12-22 16:06:21	FinalX	Mind you, this is a dual https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/83356/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2630-v3-20m-cache-2-40-ghz.html with 64GB RAM.. uses almost nothing of it

2020-12-23 13:14:04	ross`	can someone please help me understand error_page and redirection for reverse proxies? What I am trying to is create a proxy so that when I go to http://with.im/foo.tld/more/path it first tries to go to http://foo.tld/more/path. If there is redirect (like for tls) then it handles that internally, and always returns the response html back to the same request location (in browser) so no redirect just response.

2020-12-25 01:34:10	kerframil	cyberquarks: drop server_name and define "listen 80 default_server;" in the first example.
2020-12-25 01:34:45	kerframil	here's why:
2020-12-25 01:35:25	kerframil	actually, I can't remember what the bot fact is now.
2020-12-25 01:35:55	cyberquarks	kerframil okay I see, I will try it
2020-12-25 01:35:57	kerframil	anyway, a server_name match comes first, and a listen directive with default_server comes second.
2020-12-25 01:36:24	kerframil	you want at least one default_server for every (ip):port tuple you ever listen on, ideally. if you don't do this, you run the risk of the first parsed server being the default, which can lead to disaster.

2020-12-25 01:39:04	thresh	http://nginx.org/r/server_name also tells how the server blocks are chosen
2020-12-25 01:40:35	cyberquarks	thresh i works for you, what could be wrong in my conf
2020-12-25 01:40:39	cyberquarks	it*
2020-12-25 01:40:42	kerframil	ok. I stand by the suggestion to use default_server, though.
2020-12-25 01:40:50	thresh	cyberquarks, dunno, we didnt see your full configuration
2020-12-25 01:42:17	thresh	output of `nginx -T`, curl requests showing it's indeed hitting a wrong one, and access/error logs might be helpful

2020-12-25 01:49:21	thresh	the one in gist currently has syntax errors, which means it's not a configuration you're running

2020-12-30 21:30:44	TDT	Hey all.  I'm fairly new to Nginx, and am running into some issues regarding reverse proxies.  Did a few hours of research and testing, and haven't got anywhere.  The use case is that I have a single nginx container as the main point (myhost.mydomain), and other docker containers that have internal links. I verified the internal links are fine.  I'm trying to use "location /container1 {... }" to use proxy_pass to the other docker containers.  The initial
2020-12-30 21:30:44	TDT	communication attempt is fine, but once that page loads, it's requesting assets that are on the root (/), which nginx (the main point) doesn't know how to deal with.  This is causing web applications to fail entirely.  I looked at rewrite rules to see if there's some way to rewrite the stream coming back, replacing any urls for resources from "/$asset" to "/container1/$asset".  I've found little luck about this.  My goal is to eventually keep those docker
