2020-12-20 18:06:24	KirkMcDonald	But Python has e.g. things which happen when the stack unwinds, which you might not want to happen in two distinct processes.
2020-12-20 18:07:10	syle	when doing IPC shit always have a lock
2020-12-20 18:07:24	KirkMcDonald	There's an argument that you should call fork() from a new thread, created for the purpose, so that the unwinding stack stops at a known place that you have control over.
2020-12-20 18:07:37	supakeen	Eh, that's pretty detailed :)
2020-12-20 18:08:31	supakeen	Anyways the above talk about fork-ing and communication between processes is what the `multiprocessing` module does so I wouldn't go implementing it myself.
2020-12-20 18:08:47	KirkMcDonald	Though, you should also be exiting this child process with os._exit(), so this may be a belts-and-suspenders sort of thing.

2020-12-20 21:41:36	rann	Looking for a bit of best practice advice. I use argparse, setting up a pretty complex app. This works fine and i have a args: Namespace object which contains all the set things I care about. Now, I usually don't pass this entire object along, but specifically the things I care about (so: someRootObject(self.args.DIRECTORY) instead of someRootObject(self.args). I now find myself needing more and more stuff from args and am
2020-12-20 21:41:36	rann	contemplating passing args "whole". Is this frowned upon? Am I not seeing a potential pitfall?

2020-12-20 22:56:48	velix	altendky: 40-41
2020-12-20 22:56:54	velix	40-41 to the block 25-28
2020-12-20 22:57:08	altendky	velix: what part confuses you?
2020-12-20 22:57:08	velix	25-28 is a never ending loop
2020-12-20 22:57:12	nkuttler	well the threads never end, so join waits forever?
2020-12-20 22:57:18	bjs	velix: 25-28 starts the threads, and 40-41 waits for all the threads to finish.  What other order were you imagining to do those things in?
2020-12-20 22:57:25	altendky	velix: no, 25-28 is not never ending
2020-12-20 22:57:38	bjs	velix: 25-28 isn't a never ending loop though? it just starts  some threads and continues.
2020-12-20 22:57:41	CrazyH	velix, I don't know for sure, but if you learn more about thread.start, thread.append and thread.join I bet it might answer your question
2020-12-20 22:58:14	velix	bjs: sorry, 32-38 is never ending

2020-12-20 22:58:43	altendky	velix: yes, because you never choose to end the loop
2020-12-20 22:58:55	CrazyH	velix, it might also help if you re-post the code with some help comments in it that relate to your specific question
2020-12-20 22:58:57	altendky	(unless there's an exception i guess)

2020-12-20 22:59:19	bjs	velix: lines 40-41 happen to also be a never ending loop because the threads never end
2020-12-20 22:59:41	altendky	well, 41 is just a never ending line.  the loop bit is 'fine'
2020-12-20 22:59:41	velix	my problem is: when I remove 40-41, the code stops working. That's what I don't get :D
2020-12-20 23:00:03	velix	but let me put comments on it first
2020-12-20 23:00:05	altendky	velix: yeah, that doesn't make sense since there's no reason it would even be reached.
2020-12-20 23:00:05	bjs	velix: well if lines 32-38 are never ending, then it never reaches lines 40-41 so what you say can't be right

2020-12-20 23:04:45	bjs	velix: right, it's important when everything wants to stop, to wait for everyone to have finished

How this works is that there's a bunch of people that put text on a google sheet. then I manually export to csv, and import the csv file into an SQL database (that the website pulls the data from). What I would like to do is to automate all of this crap :D Is there any available way to
2020-12-20 23:25:30	alexkalopsia	create a script capable of accessing the google sheet and perform the export for me?

2020-12-21 02:28:11	tete_	bjs, thanks.
2020-12-21 02:28:12	bjs	tete_: your code calls the `self.ftpserver.download` method (aka the ftpservice .download method on the mock) so that's the thing you want to assert got called.
2020-12-21 02:28:54	tete_	ok i think now i have it
2020-12-21 02:29:04	tete_	does this only apply when using mock or in general in python?
2020-12-21 02:29:27	bjs	tete_: this is just how calling works (and not just in Python).
2020-12-21 02:29:35	tete_	in java it is very different
2020-12-21 02:29:40	bjs	tete_: no it's exactly the same
2020-12-21 02:29:47	rann	if I want to use re.match on a str object containing an entire file, do I need to beware of something? I'm finding that my regexp is not matching whilst if I do something like .readline on stdin, it does match
2020-12-21 02:30:53	tete_	bjs, no... in java i use verify(myMock).myMethod()
2020-12-21 02:31:36	bjs	tete_: exactly, you don't say `verify(myMock()).myMethod()` do you?

2020-12-21 02:32:48	alexkalopsia	I am trying to build an sql query, that looks something like this: "INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, col3, col4) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, val4). Now, I already have a tuple values = (val1,val2,val3,val4). Is there a way to translate the tuple into a string, so that I can directly feed it into the query? Or do I have to rebuild a string cycling
2020-12-21 02:32:48	alexkalopsia	through all the values?
2020-12-21 02:32:56	bjs	you make sure you're checking the method call was on the correct mock object.  The Python and Java libraries chose sligtly differently looking APIs for how to do that assert call but in both cases you have to pass the right mock to the assertions
2020-12-21 02:33:02	tete_	correct, but that still does not make it clear to me, i guess its just a different syntax. in java i would write: verify(ftpservice).download(); in python i would assume ftpservice.download().assert_called_once
2020-12-21 02:33:07	bjs	tete_: for Java it wants the object you called the method on, for Python it wants the object that got called

2020-12-21 02:34:57	bjs	tete_: it's much more common in Python to have access to random callable objects that aren't just methods, so the API is a bit more explicit in that the object you pass to the assertion is the object to be called

2020-12-21 03:04:05	alexkalopsia	graingert for what I understand join just sticks all the values together, so it would result in val1val2val3val4 ?
2020-12-21 03:04:13	zumba_addict	wow, it's correct :)
2020-12-21 03:04:30	alexkalopsia	but i guess i misunderstood how you suggest to use it
2020-12-21 03:04:47	bjs	zumba_addict: this is why when I said you have a file that has those things in it, seems wrong
2020-12-21 03:04:53	zumba_addict	I guess i need to get used to seeing bytearray in screen output when I'm doing that

2020-12-21 03:05:04	bjs	zumba_addict: beacuse those things are just made up by python when you print,  they don't exist. So if they end up in a file, someone did something wrong

So, for example, if all items matched the result woudl be a 5. If 4 of 5 matched, the result would be a 4, etc.

2020-12-22 06:09:16	yates	has it ever occurred to the creators of the documentation that, rather than searching/reading through prodigious textual information, it would be useful to break things down hierarchically at the header level and in the Table of Contents pane? E.g., have a section "Functions" with all the functions, then "Modules" for all the modules.

2020-12-22 08:54:34	farhan	Question on how to do this database activity. I am running SELECT on a table. If a row does not exist, I will do an API call to get a value and INSERT it into the database. The problem is with concurrency. If two async sessions SELECT at the same time, both run the API call at the same time and thus both insert the same value. Is there a way to prevent that sort of pattern?

2020-12-22 16:24:25	Biganon	Hi! I'm using requests to GET a page, and I get served an obsolete page even though it has changed (I can see that with my browser). Adding a random query string to the URL allows me to retrieve the fresh page. Does request have a cache of its own? Or what could explain this phenomenon?
2020-12-22 16:25:12	Biganon	according to SO, requests doesn't have its own cache, and besides I doubt it would survive between subsequent calls of the script
2020-12-22 16:26:27	ammar2	indeed, it's probably a cache on the server side
2020-12-22 16:27:28	nanonyme	It's weird though that the new page can be seen with browser

2020-12-22 16:27:56	nanonyme	Ah, okay, so it could be different cache edge
2020-12-22 16:28:00	Biganon	I'm just not used to servers caching what they send me I guess
2020-12-22 16:28:07	Biganon	or at least it's the first time I get bitten by that

2020-12-22 20:42:25	MrGaraj	Hello. Quite a long time since I've asked something here. Short question: I'm trying to build a really simple auto-protection mechanism for my USB. For now, I'm creating a standalone pyinstaller executable (on that USB) which, once is run, is supposed to delete everything on a specific folder from that USB. The problem with this is...it's a volume,
2020-12-22 20:42:26	MrGaraj	and when I'm trying to simply do: `shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=True)` it won't work. Any ideas?
2020-12-22 20:42:26	bjs	b4d: what other lines?  is it really just a .py file?  maybe you can just import it ...
2020-12-22 20:43:27	CAPTCHA_REQUIRED	KirkMcDonald: what are the () doing inside an if statement?
2020-12-22 20:43:36	CAPTCHA_REQUIRED	After the and
2020-12-22 20:43:43	CAPTCHA_REQUIRED	I've never seen that before nor in the doc

2020-12-22 20:45:23	graingert	MrGaraj: auto protection from what?
2020-12-22 20:45:31	KirkMcDonald	CAPTCHA_REQUIRED: They're parentheses. They control the order of operations. As parentheses do.
2020-12-22 20:45:49	bjs	b4d: okay, just pretend each line is JSON and loads each line.  Or if you're the one who made the file, just make a file that has a format that can be read directly
2020-12-22 20:46:10	MrGaraj	@graingert that's really just some context around my question. It doesn't quite matter ^^
2020-12-22 20:46:16	KirkMcDonald	CAPTCHA_REQUIRED: They are needed because 'and' has a higher precedence than 'or'.

What I need is a way to always cut the list so that its length is divisible by X (where X is 4 in this case). I thought i found i smart way (shown initially) but its not so smart, because in the case where the len of the is is already divisible by 4
2020-12-22 22:44:23	diverdude	 (i.e. % == 0) i just get an empty list back. Is there a clever expression that can cater for both situations? (i.e. % >= 0) ?

2020-12-23 14:06:46	KirkMcDonald	I don't think that's the best approach, since you're dropping values but the keys must remain consecutive.

2020-12-23 21:54:59	bjs	velix: if you want to cancel pending (reserved) jobs which haven't started yet, it's a little more tricky in older versions of Python.

2020-12-24 06:20:06	altendky	+ vs. * is, sure, some choice.  the latter looks more like zip which seems like no choice

2020-12-24 06:21:55	fooman2011	Hello. At my program init, I have to add path to sys.path before the first import. But my IDE warns me "import should be at the top of the file". What is the correct way to solve this use case ?

2020-12-24 06:22:38	_habnabit	rann, the problem you might end up with is you do the + or * in a loop and end up doing a lot of copying of temporary lists

2020-12-24 06:23:43	summonner	fooman2011, have a look at the python project structure on 'hitchhikers guide to python' for a way to import libraries at different layers. it sounds like you could benefit from that
2020-12-24 06:23:44	fooman2011	but I must also call os.environ["PYSDL2_DLL_PATH"] = sdlpath     before calling from sdl2 import *

2020-12-24 06:24:38	altendky	rann: was `16:19 <rann> for member in, mul, plus, etc` just a nerdy way to say 'here are the *, + etc options, how do you feel about each?'?

2020-12-24 06:25:43	AndreYuhai	Does importing a package with __main__ module affect pickling? Because I am trying with to pickle a class and when I want to load pickle, it searches for the wrong place for the class. At least that's what I think
2020-12-24 06:25:53	AndreYuhai	For this class 'Foo': <class '__main__.Foo'>
2020-12-24 06:25:54	_habnabit	AndreYuhai, yes. pickle is very bad
2020-12-24 06:26:06	AndreYuhai	_habnabit: how can overcome that?
2020-12-24 06:26:13	_habnabit	AndreYuhai, ideally, stop using pickle
2020-12-24 06:26:16	SnoopJ	I guess the old implementation probably popped the values off the stack, then reversed that

2020-12-24 12:20:16	omnidapps	I did the `list_a = append`... my bad
2020-12-24 12:20:29	amstan	but if you list_a = list_a + [newelement], you're esesntially making a new list, copying list_a into it, then throwing away the old list

2020-12-24 12:22:07	amstan	omnidapps: this is also why += doesn't exist for python strings, yet you can easily do mystring = mystring + something

2020-12-24 12:23:39	omnidapps	yes
2020-12-24 12:23:42	_habnabit	not always; there are some optimizations where you can reuse the same string for += sometimes

2020-12-25 03:47:04	SnoopJ	I'm trying to make a code sample showing off that a decorator will hang indefinitely when called with a family of parameters. Is there a way I can run the decoration with a timeout? I fussed around with asyncio.wait_for a bit, but it seems that the decorator hangs before the event loop gets ahold of it (i.e. while the coroutine is being created)

2020-12-25 11:58:02	CrazyH	So before I get into classes... let me just ask the simple question of: Is there anything in python that is exactly like a structure in C? Because that's exactly what I need. I need to define a structure, then form an array of that structure

2020-12-25 12:01:14	altendky	CrazyH: you have a group of things and each thing has common bits you want to describe.  a class is a good way to describe that thing and creating instances can hold the data for each

2020-12-25 14:33:55	CrazyH	That is probably the most counter intuitive and unexpected thing that I have ever run into in any language
2020-12-25 14:34:27	CrazyH	There MUST be a good reason why they made it that way.
2020-12-25 14:34:29	KirkMcDonald	CrazyH: It's... really very straightforward? It just means that assigning something doesn't copy it.
2020-12-25 14:34:38	KirkMcDonald	CrazyH: Lots of languages work in this way.
2020-12-25 14:35:00	CrazyH	I know what it means... but why the hell do it that way? :-D
2020-12-25 14:35:23	CrazyH	Not mocking by the way... but I am really curios
2020-12-25 14:35:35	KirkMcDonald	Mostly it's C++ that doesn't do it that way...
2020-12-25 14:35:58	CrazyH	I mean... even in assembly if I move one register to another. It's a copy
2020-12-25 14:36:15	KirkMcDonald	CrazyH: If you like, you may think of everything in Python being a pointer to an object.
2020-12-25 14:36:22	KirkMcDonald	CrazyH: So you're copying the pointer.
2020-12-25 14:36:43	KirkMcDonald	(It is useful to think of it this way because it is quite literally what it is doing.)
2020-12-25 14:37:07	CrazyH	Yeah. I'm already thinking that way now. I just don't get why someone would purposely design this behavior into a language this high up chain
2020-12-25 14:38:06	KirkMcDonald	It would be somewhat mad to e.g. copy lists every time you pass them to functions.

2020-12-25 14:40:36	CrazyH	I guess I'm just used to only dealing with pointers when I either tell the language to specifically do so... or if I'm in a situation where nothing else is really makes sense ( like file pointers... copying the entire file if you passed the pointer around would be insane )

2020-12-26 11:58:23	wolfram	nedbat: Right.. it is just that in the meantime a few dozens objects were created and went out of scope so I was a bit surprised, hence the question about having such a mechanism on a per-class type basis.
2020-12-26 11:58:45	nedbat	wolfram: for built-in types, there are specialized freelists, but not for user-defined, afaik

2020-12-26 11:59:17	wolfram	nedbat: But wait, now I realise that they were small integers, so maybe nothing was actually created because they were taken from that pre-allocated cache of small integers.
2020-12-26 11:59:42	nedbat	wolfram: small ints are always the same objects, they are never freed
2020-12-26 12:00:01	wolfram	Yes, exactly, so that could explain it all.

2020-12-26 15:29:21	nkuttler	mostly different versions and install scope
2020-12-26 15:29:56	overyander	why do distros make pkgs if everything is already included and available in pip? pip installs to global unless a venv is specified doesn't it?
2020-12-26 15:30:07	matsaman	overyander: distro packages are for distro package deps
2020-12-26 15:30:33	matsaman	whether they abstract the python ones from pip installs or from custom placements, that could be more a matter of preference
2020-12-26 15:30:39	domhnall	and that's what the distro is for...distribute packages.
2020-12-26 15:30:47	matsaman	yes, with its own package manager
2020-12-26 15:31:02	matsaman	but I do see your side of the argument also
2020-12-26 15:31:08	domhnall	which is another topic in and of itself.. @ package managers.
2020-12-26 15:31:14	matsaman	so for example on
2020-12-26 15:31:19	matsaman	Gentoo
2020-12-26 15:31:30	matsaman	you would probably have to add all new code to the system to be able to modify pip packages
2020-12-26 15:31:41	matsaman	rather than just taking a tarball, and dealing with those, like every other package

2020-12-27 10:18:31	cyphase	as an aside.. i noticed this as soon as i said it and decided not to be pedantic, but i don't want to leave it lying.. technically sorting under a key gives you a set of potential sorts, since multiple items could possibly tie with the same key. at that point it depends on the initial order and whether the sorting algorithm is stable (which python's is be default)

You're free to disagree, but really you started seeing push back against this prior to the invention of actual programming languages; this kind of observation comes out of the formalization of mathematics in terms

2020-12-31 10:32:09	_habnabit	seal308, 'Error' isn't a thing except sometimes people name exception types with that in it
2020-12-31 10:32:46	seal308	Is a syntax error an exception then? I thought you can't handle that, so how can it be an exception?

2020-12-31 10:33:38	ali1234	it is, and you can handle it - whether you can recover from it is a different problem
2020-12-31 10:33:38	_habnabit	seal308, you can catch it if it happens when you import something, sure
2020-12-31 10:33:45	_habnabit	seal308, or if you raise SyntaxError yourself
2020-12-31 10:33:57	_habnabit	seal308, but it being called 'Error' doesn't mean anything
2020-12-31 10:35:23	seal308	So if there is incorrect code what an error is not generated, an exception is generated. And an unhandled exception crashes your program?
2020-12-31 10:35:41	_habnabit	seal308, yep

2020-12-31 10:43:27	Affliction`	seal308: an example of where an exception doesn't signal an error would be iterators
2020-12-31 10:43:51	Affliction`	Where a StopIteration exception is thrown when the iterator is complete
2020-12-31 10:43:56	seal308	no, i'm new to programming. Just online there is a lot of articles that seem to use exceptions and errors interchangably. And when using Except you can use a "error message" wasn't quite sure why they didn't call it an "exception msg"
2020-12-31 10:43:59	Affliction`	a for loop handles that specially
2020-12-31 10:45:19	squirrel	seal308: yeah it's a bit confusing and in some languages (like java) errors and exceptions can mean different things..

2020-12-31 11:38:21	abesab	What I have works fine when I'm using `basicConfig()` in my main module. But I wanted to customize it more, so I replaced `basicConfig()` with `file_handler = logging.FileHandler('logs/myLog-%s.log' % now)` and `logger.addHandler(file_handler)`
2020-12-31 11:38:38	abesab	When I did that however, I lost all log messages from other modules
2020-12-31 11:39:10	abesab	So the only part that I want to do manually is whatever `basicConfig()` was doing to ensure the other modules log messages are still used

2020-12-31 11:40:40	abesab	I think I should try to print to console the "tree" of loggers in both cases to see what changes
2020-12-31 11:40:44	altendky	abesab: ok, so you get the root logger via `root_logger = logging.getlogger()` with no parameter.  only do that in a place where you enter your program and use it only for registering handlers and config etc.  also get a separate `logger = logging.getlogger(__name__)` for any actual logging you do.

2021-01-12 23:16:51	utman	grym, generally it is targetted for ubuntu, users will be having runtime and python. so i think these need not to be packaged. Only dependencies like gtk or database which i generally fed up need to be grouped.
2021-01-12 23:17:01	deniska	utman: either you assume the system doesn't have python and then you have to ship your own. Or assume that it does, but then you can more or less reliably only do it on linux, and only if you build a distro specific package
2021-01-12 23:17:31	deniska	utman: if you target, say, specific ubuntu versions, you should look into building .deb package
