2020-12-20 05:59:40	mazula	I buy the domain

2020-12-20 21:43:36	wyoung	theskillwithin: yeah, I could have told you that :)  I come from a sysadmin, backend dev, devops background
2020-12-20 21:43:49	wyoung	My current role on most projects is devops
2020-12-20 21:44:19	wyoung	API gateways doesn't support chunk encoding either, which is annoying.
2020-12-20 21:44:51	wyoung	I generally use AWS ECS for anything serious.  API gateway for inline CloudFormation scripts for notification and build webhooks
2020-12-20 21:45:39	wyoung	I have been looking at AppSync too, but it is also lacking
2020-12-20 21:45:53	wyoung	So I use host GraphQL via Lambdas or ECS too
2020-12-20 21:47:29	theskillwithin	the last proper sysadmin i knew told me his job in the future was not going to be needed, and I did not believe him.  and then now with serverless the devs have taken over

2020-12-20 22:01:43	wyoung	There are just less job positions now unles you need to run your own server, which still is required in most government spaces, including schools

2020-12-20 22:06:31	theskillwithin	maybe he wasn't that great, our ansible script was always dated
2020-12-20 22:06:56	wyoung	I used puppet and chef last
2020-12-20 22:07:02	wyoung	I haven't used ansible

2020-12-20 22:07:17	theskillwithin	centos all the way for him i think
2020-12-20 22:07:19	wyoung	I love Ubuntu
2020-12-20 22:07:24	wyoung	Centos is shit though
2020-12-20 22:07:55	wyoung	If I wanted to use a distro that had out of date packages in order to be stable I would rather slackware or FreeBSD
2020-12-20 22:08:11	wyoung	although both have better update options than centos these days
2020-12-20 22:08:29	wyoung	even compiling from source is a better option in both  platforms

2020-12-20 22:14:16	wyoung	kubernetes is what you put on your resume, ECS Fargat is what you actually use.
2020-12-20 22:14:42	wyoung	Assuming you are going the AWS route
2020-12-20 22:15:06	wyoung	kubernetes is good if you do'nt want to be locked into AWS.  If you didn't wanted to be locked into AWS you woulsn't be in this channel :)
2020-12-20 22:15:35	theskillwithin	where I work now, the backends utalize so many AWS stuffs, I am clueless to a lot of it.
