2020-12-20 03:39:43	NCS_One	if user messes with form data, eg: the form has a radio button with option: 1, 2, 3; but on the server you get the value 4, you rerender the form with a message informing the user that the field is incorrect, or you redirect the user to an error page with a bad request state?

2020-12-20 04:34:50	j416	Wessie: why would it be racy?
2020-12-20 04:35:35	Wessie	in the sense that the information is out of date right afterwards
2020-12-20 04:35:52	Wessie	because another reader might have read the value that signaled ready to you
2020-12-20 04:36:06	pyrrhus	I think it's because another process could try to read from the channel whilst the current process is checking if the channel contains any data
2020-12-20 04:36:34	Wessie	so you effectively can't really do much with the knowledge that a channel contains a value

2020-12-20 22:16:05	tatooine-sunset	hi! if i have for example a users.GetById(id int) function which gets a user from the db, is it better to return a user struct or a pointer to one? coming from c# i feel returning the value itself instead of just a pointer would be wasteful of memory and cpu time but i also feel it would be more semantically correct. what's the accepted best practice?

2020-12-22 09:00:17	farhan	hm...I'm wondering how to resolve these anti-patterns with concurrency working with databases....
2020-12-22 09:00:44	farhan	I am running a SELECT. If a value does not exist, I run a RestAPI call to retrieve some data, then later INSERT it.
2020-12-22 09:01:15	farhan	The problem is, if two goroutines try the SELECT at the same time and both come back empty, both will try to INSERT at the same time.

2020-12-22 09:03:26	nperez_	delegate the update responsibility to a single goroutine and have it check
2020-12-22 09:04:36	nperez_	Also, depending on the database, you might be able to use an upsert and as long as both goroutines have the same data it'll be okay (aside from the terrible waste of resources)
2020-12-22 09:05:50	farhan	would another routine then run the SELECT call?

2020-12-22 09:07:27	nperez_	You could have as many run that select call as you want and all of them have a channel they use to send populate-this-entry messages to the one go routine doing the updating, so that updates are serialized and you can kill duplicates

2020-12-22 16:52:23	medfly	Hi all. I need to figure out if I depend on a vulnerable go module. It's mentioned in go.sum, but not in vendors/modules.txt or go.mod. I don't know what that particular scenario means

2020-12-22 17:00:40	KirkMcDonald	medfly: A transitive dependency.
2020-12-22 17:02:00	KirkMcDonald	medfly: go.sum can also contain entries which are no longer needed. You can run `go mod tidy` to clean it up.
2020-12-22 17:06:08	medfly	Hmmmm. I assumed that having vendored dependencies means "all the code I used lives in the vendor/ directory. Nothing else will be fetched from the internet and used."
2020-12-22 17:06:20	medfly	is it only the first layer of dependencies?

2020-12-22 17:50:34	kazakh2	i need to remove all urls from a multiline string. i want to handle different "types" like http://domain.com; https://www.domain.com; www.domain.com; domain.com/path/to/files?with=get&elements; and so on.
2020-12-22 17:50:50	kazakh2	i was thinking regex, obviously, but that feels like something somebody already "did" before
2020-12-22 17:53:51	medfly	this might be hard to do without an outright "test whether you can connect to it". someone could put "mywebsite" in /etc/hosts and then mywebsite would be a valid website
2020-12-22 17:54:19	kazakh2	medfly im parsing texts from some chat so that's not likely to happen.
2020-12-22 17:54:54	kazakh2	people are likely to use http instead of https, or even omit that altogether and use just www.google.com/path
2020-12-22 17:54:56	medfly	(this may happen if someone makes their machine hostname 'mywebsite')
2020-12-22 17:55:08	kazakh2	i know. that's an edge case i'm not worried about at all.
2020-12-22 17:55:15	medfly	okay.

2020-12-22 18:14:15	tatooine-sunset	would you leave it this way?

2020-12-22 18:14:53	A_D	when you get to talking with external stuff (DBs, files, et al) you often end up with a lot of error handling
2020-12-22 18:15:13	A_D	some libraries use panics and recovers to simplify things, though I wouldnt unless you really know what you're doing

2020-12-23 14:11:11	dansan	I have a function where I'm taking an unsafe.Pointer and storing it and I would just rather pass it as interface{} instead.  But I suppose that's what Go interfaces are for.  I could define an interface that each of the struct types implement, but it's in a foreign package. :(
2020-12-23 14:11:45	dansan	You're not allowed to add methods (with a pointer receiver) to a type defined in another package are you?
2020-12-23 14:11:56	kodah	dansan: no
2020-12-23 14:12:00	dansan	that's what I thought.
2020-12-23 14:12:43	dansan	lol, I could always just get an unsafe.Pointer of the interface{} *its self*!!  I think I've seen a C struct for it, but that's super ugly-ish.
2020-12-23 14:12:45	kodah	you could embed that type and then build methods off of it, but that's not great. generally i just build wrapping packages if i have a need for that
2020-12-23 14:13:27	dansan	kodah: Thank you, that was my thought as well.  I wish Google had some common interfaces for the various protocol buffer descriptor types.
2020-12-23 14:14:21	dansan	I think I'm going to start a package called goevil with functions to do stuff like that -- steal the pointer from an interface.
2020-12-23 14:14:37	dansan	or maybe "goimmoral" :)
2020-12-23 14:15:24	kodah	i'd star that

2020-12-23 14:16:46	dansan	So allegedly, according to the internet, Go stores interfaces as a struct with two successive pointers: to the type and then value.
2020-12-23 14:17:12	dansan	My boss is never happy when he learns I've "gone off into the weeds", but going to try this out.

2020-12-23 19:58:31	dan01	I see
2020-12-23 20:01:01	bpalmer	One issue with unexported fields, for example: then if they're supposed to be set at initialization, you need to write a constructor/factory function that just forwards each parameter to the relevant field, and you may have to think about how to distinguish an initialized-by-constructor object from an initialized-by-default object.
2020-12-23 20:01:35	bpalmer	e.g., given type Point struct { x, y int }, people can still do Point{} to get a point where x and y are both 0

2020-12-24 06:39:40	stephen87	hello, im very new to golang.  I am trying to run a goroutine, but i keep getting a segmentation violation for a invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.  I'm configures about is causing it because I am not passing the routine any vars/structs.  Is there a debugger or something i can use to see what is causing it?

2020-12-24 06:46:32	mrig	thought that said, fmt.Print debugging is quite common with go too. Because it compiles so fast.
2020-12-24 06:48:09	mrig	stephen87: you could use if value == nil { log.Fatal("stopping here") }; It may sometimes be faster than setting up a debugger.

2020-12-25 01:15:30	SoF	what's the idiomatic way to resolve the problem where I have an interface which defines Foo, and now I want to be able to call Foo on a variable which is a pointer to the interface?
2020-12-25 01:15:45	SoF	without dereferencing (*fooer).Foo()
2020-12-25 01:16:32	nevivurn	SoF: huh, doesn't that just work?
2020-12-25 01:16:48	SoF	sorry i think i wasn't being clear, i *dont* want to derefence using (*fooer)
2020-12-25 01:17:11	SoF	i want to say "hey this function Foo also exists on pointers to this interface"
2020-12-25 01:18:40	SoF	merry xmas everyone by the way
2020-12-25 01:18:53	fizzie	I don't think there's a specific way to do that. Avoid having a pointer to an interface in the first place? They're kind of rare in practice.
2020-12-25 01:19:01	nevivurn	Huh, I misunderstood the go spec on this one, I guess.

2020-12-25 01:19:51	fizzie	There are rules about the methods defined with a receiver of T also being in the method set of *T, but no corresponding rules about pointers to interfaces.
2020-12-25 01:20:53	SoF	fizzie: thanks, i didn't even try just not using a pointer
2020-12-25 01:21:06	SoF	I didn't want to use the value directly because I wanted to return nil, but i thought i can only do that on pointers
2020-12-25 01:21:18	SoF	interfaces work too it turns out, me
2020-12-25 01:22:09	nevivurn	Eh, it works?
2020-12-25 01:22:10	SoF	in hindsight, it makes sense that nil is the zero-type of an interface since there is no "default" type it could refer to
2020-12-25 01:22:28	SoF	nevivurn: yup, im returning "nil" as type MyInterface
2020-12-25 01:22:31	fizzie	Yeah, any interface type can have a `nil` value. The idiomatic style tends to favor plain interfaces (`io.Writer`, `io.Reader`, ...) and if they need "reference semantics", then pointers to structs as the types implementing those interfaces (`*os.File`, ...).

2020-12-25 01:23:20	SoF	fizzie: makes sense, ty
2020-12-25 01:23:36	nevivurn	In the spec, "The method set of an interface type is its interface.", and "The method set of the [...] pointer type *T is [...] all methods declared with receiver *T or T"
2020-12-25 01:24:16	nevivurn	I'm guessing that since interfaces don't have any methods defined on them, the method set of the pointer to an interface is empty
2020-12-25 01:24:42	nevivurn	Though the method set of the interface itself is the interface. Hm.

2020-12-25 01:33:01	fizzie	Yes, but they're not "methods declared with receiver *T or T".
2020-12-25 01:33:08	fizzie	They're just methods that make up the interface.
2020-12-25 01:34:18	nevivurn	The wording in the parenthesis is unfortunate, but I guess it's usually you don't need pointers to interfaces that often.
2020-12-25 01:34:22	fizzie	Yeah, I guess the "it also contains the method set of T" is a bit inexact, strictly speaking.
2020-12-25 01:34:58	fizzie	Well, unless you read the "any other type" constraining what T means also for the "corresponding pointer type" section.

2020-12-25 01:35:41	fizzie	As in: "The method set of an interface type is its interface. The method set of any other type T --" => T is not an interface; "The method set of the corresponding pointer type *T --" => *T is not a pointer to an interface.
2020-12-25 01:37:41	fizzie	(T itself could still be a pointer to an interface, since it's "any other type", but then it would just say that a pointer to a pointer to an interface contains the method set of a pointer to an interface, which is presumably useless but correct.)
2020-12-25 01:37:54	fizzie	Not that I think language-lawyering is how the spec ought to be read or anything.
2020-12-25 01:38:00	nevivurn	Ahh, as in "corresponding pointer type *T", the "corresponding" is about the 'T is not an interface type' case
2020-12-25 01:38:06	fizzie	Right.
2020-12-25 01:38:11	nevivurn	That makes a lot more sense
2020-12-25 01:39:14	nevivurn	Well, it's better to have a language-lawyer-proof spec if you have any, since the compiler is going to be the worst language lawyer of them all.

In the past I've used an external YAML but lately a JSON file and just read it in (and have it in my .gitignore), this works pretty well but I was just wondering if anyone else has a solution to this problem?

2020-12-25 03:52:36	l0rd_hex	ahh yeah, can they leak through /proc?
2020-12-25 03:53:26	medfly	yes, but presumably anyone that can read that could also read a bunch of other things
2020-12-25 03:53:55	l0rd_hex	I would still have to set the env variable too

2020-12-25 03:55:53	medfly	Apparently /proc does let you read the environment of other users. That's a bummer

2020-12-25 03:56:08	medfly	granted, I am not testing linux here, so ymmv
2020-12-25 03:56:39	j416	medfly: if that's the case, there are probably other issues that are more urgent to solve :D
2020-12-25 03:56:49	l0rd_hex	I work in security usually so I am playing the devil's advocate here :)
2020-12-25 03:56:57	EdFletcher	a file chmod'ed to only be readable by your user is more secure than env vars -- that said many popular tools (like aws-cli) allow for sourcing creds from *both* env vars and a file
2020-12-25 03:57:37	j416	EdFletcher: except when it's not
2020-12-25 03:57:40	j416	but, thanks
2020-12-25 03:58:21	l0rd_hex	The situation is probably less risky with containers, etc.
2020-12-25 03:58:32	EdFletcher	j416: please elaborate?
2020-12-25 03:59:10	l0rd_hex	but I was just curious if there was another solution
2020-12-25 04:00:00	j416	EdFletcher: I think you know more than me about the particular workings of chmodded file vs. env vars, so I'll assume you're perfectly correct in that sense. I'm referring things like the fact that you'd need to distribute that file somehow, too.

2020-12-25 07:29:00	b0nn	It's platform specific rules now that I think about it, so platform specific code it is

2020-12-27 10:38:13	fizzie	Makes sense, though. Accessing a key that doesn't exist returns the zero value of the map's element type, which for an interface (the only thing you could apply a type assertion to) is nil.

2020-12-31 09:23:27	pjs	interesting, getting gopls working with ale is completely painless. I wonder if I'd ever adjust to using the autocomplete. What other benefits come from gopls?
2020-12-31 09:24:44	j416	I use go to definition and gorename quite a bit
2020-12-31 09:25:08	j416	generating implementation stubs from an interface is also something I use
2020-12-31 09:25:11	pjs	Ahh, gorename seems useful actually to fix all my "this" usage lol
2020-12-31 09:25:43	pjs	j416: don't suppose you know of a solid tutorial for gopls (w/ vim preferred but anything should do)
2020-12-31 09:25:47	j416	also, not related to gopls, but I use goimports in place of gofmt. goimports is a superset of gofmt.
2020-12-31 09:26:10	j416	pjs: nope, never looked.
2020-12-31 09:26:17	j416	see docs for vim-go, perhaps

2020-12-31 09:26:59	j416	GoAddTags I use frequently
2020-12-31 09:27:42	j416	not sure how much of that uses gopls.
2020-12-31 09:28:23	pjs	j416: thanks! I'll check into vim-go. I don't have that currently
2020-12-31 09:28:38	j416	ah, thought that's what you had
2020-12-31 09:29:03	j416	if you're a vim user, I don't know anything better than vim-go.
2020-12-31 09:29:30	j416	GoAlternate and GoCoverageToggle are handy. I've the latter on leader+c.
2020-12-31 09:31:50	pjs	No just ale for linting/fixing.
2020-12-31 09:32:08	lilgopher	I use staticcheck a lot: https://staticcheck.io/
2020-12-31 09:32:57	j416	oh, ale is an editor
2020-12-31 09:33:06	j416	I thought it was something for vim, sorry
2020-12-31 09:33:22	pjs	j416: ale is a vim plugin, yes
2020-12-31 09:33:36	j416	oh, it is
2020-12-31 09:33:42	j416	googled it and found http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/ale-edit

2020-12-31 09:47:02	lilgopher	does somebody remember https://limetext.github.io/ ?
2020-12-31 09:47:48	lilgopher	I thought the project died, but I don't see any comment about this in the website/repo. Doesn't seem to be active though
2020-12-31 09:48:35	lilgopher	It was a backend writen in go and I guess a frontend using web technologies

2020-12-31 10:04:58	prologic	I'm seeing Response.ContehtLength of -1 for many net/http.Client calls when if I `curl` the same URI I see a "content-length: ..." that is the correct length/size of the data. What's going on here?
2020-12-31 10:05:32	prologic	note the case content-length: not Content-Length:
2020-12-31 10:06:12	NCS_One	http2?
2020-12-31 10:06:34	NCS_One	prologic: `
2020-12-31 10:07:16	prologic	I don't knot at this stage, I don't track the remote URIs I'm fetching to see if they are HTTP/1 or HTTP/2
2020-12-31 10:07:19	prologic	Does that matter?

2020-12-31 10:07:46	NCS_One	I think that headers on http2 are all lower case
2020-12-31 10:08:25	NCS_One	but Response.ContentLength would count on that
