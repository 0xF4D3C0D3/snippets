2020-12-20 03:42:02	Guest20	ok now the register will be entry point for invocation of the system calls ?
2020-12-20 03:42:03	jn__	the instructions are documented in Volume 2, chapter "instruction set reference, A-M"
2020-12-20 03:42:13	jn__	Guest20: No
2020-12-20 03:42:40	jn__	No, a register can't be an entry point because those are incompatible concepts
2020-12-20 03:43:08	jn__	a register is a little piece of hardware that can store a value (usually a 32 or 64 bit number)
2020-12-20 03:43:36	jn__	an entry point is a point in the code
2020-12-20 03:43:45	jn__	a position in the code
2020-12-20 03:43:57	jn__	a line of code, you might say
2020-12-20 03:44:03	Guest20	ok the kernel will look at the register to tearn the parameter values and then it will call the functon in the library?
2020-12-20 03:44:33	jn__	in which library?
2020-12-20 03:45:58	Guest20	i understood till you message saying ".... the fault/trap/interrupt handler code in the kernel will look at the register to learn the parameter values that the userspace program passed....."

2020-12-20 03:47:43	jn__	for the exit syscall, for example, it terminates the process
2020-12-20 03:48:50	Guest20	sure

2020-12-20 21:57:31	Guest20	what happens when some app calls write() twice, does all the things related to switching to kernel, using eax register to invoke the system calls. does all of these happen again.. or somewhere there is a buffer handled by kernel to avoid this'?'
2020-12-20 21:57:37	Guest20	ince context switch is expensive, is there a buffer that tells how to go to the specific  address in kernel space ?
2020-12-20 21:57:41	Guest20		for example:     what would happen when someone does a grep in nginx log.. lets say grep has multiple results, would this call write() multiple times?
2020-12-20 21:58:21	j`ey	yes it happens multiple times
2020-12-20 22:00:35	Guest20	j`ey oh it will be such an expense right?
2020-12-20 22:01:03	j`ey	"yes"
2020-12-20 22:01:32	Guest20	any optimization available in kernel for this?

2020-12-21 01:38:49	Guest20	Hi jn__ : your thoughts on the above?
2020-12-21 01:39:34	jn__	Guest20: yes, if you call printf a second time, the whole syscall thing happens again
2020-12-21 01:39:56	Guest20	no optimizations? isnt the process expensive?
2020-12-21 01:39:56	jn__	especially if you explicitly call write twice
2020-12-21 01:41:10	jn__	there is an optimization in stdio (the part of the libc that implements printf). see setvbuf.
2020-12-21 01:43:30	Guest20	jn__ for eg: how about in case of grep, if a keyword is present multiple time, it would do a write() multiple times.. multiple times context switch happens..  by default does linux use setvbuf?

2020-12-21 01:44:13	jn__	linux (the kernel) doesn't care or know or care about the buffering mechnism that is configured with setvbuf
2020-12-21 01:44:21	jn__	it exists in userspace, in the libc
2020-12-21 01:45:50	jn__	>Normally all files are block buffered.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as stdout normally does), it is line buffered.  The standard error stream  stderr  is  always unbuffered by default.

2020-12-21 01:48:01	Guest20	when you say its line buffered - is it stored in a buffer in processor or something?
2020-12-21 01:48:04	jn__	that was a quote from the setvbuf(3) manpage
2020-12-21 01:48:35	jn__	https://manpages.debian.org/buster/manpages-dev/setvbuf.3.en.html
2020-12-21 01:48:57	jn__	a stream in that context is a FILE*

2020-12-21 02:01:57	jn__	from the manpage: "when it is block buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block"
2020-12-21 02:02:20	jn__	a "block" here is just a chunk of memory, a kilobyte or something

2020-12-22 17:45:37	kill-animals	at least software wise. I am wondering if there is anything in the kernel that I could play with to either force a charge or to not have my computer autoturn off when I unplug it.

2020-12-25 04:03:07	Guest20	hi there, a very basic question, once the kernel runs a program, it loads its code from the disk to memory.. in memory there is a concept of stack and heap

2020-12-25 04:16:14	jn__	Guest20: "stack" and "heap" are basically two different access disciplines
2020-12-25 04:16:31	Guest20	jn__ are these present in the ram?
2020-12-25 04:16:35	jn__	on the "heap", different objects have lifetimes that are independent of each other
2020-12-25 04:16:59	jn__	on the "stack", the newest-allocated object is destroyed first
2020-12-25 04:17:02	jn__	(simplified)

2020-12-25 04:17:59	Guest20	so stack and heap are the data structures to access something from the memory?
2020-12-25 04:20:06	jn__	well—  they aren't really specific data structures.  but for a given system (for example fixed versions of linux+glibc on x86), they are implemented by specific data structures
2020-12-25 04:20:18	Hello71	Guest20: you can think of it this way: the operating system gives you a big chunk of memory
2020-12-25 04:20:24	Hello71	you can decide for yourself how you want to divide it
2020-12-25 04:20:28	-->	xrash (~xrash@177.45.93.120) has joined ##kernel
2020-12-25 04:21:00	jn__	the details of how you access stack or heap memory become apparent when looking at C code or something
2020-12-25 04:21:01	Hello71	but, most people choose to divide their memory into one section for function variables and one section for dynamic data
2020-12-25 04:21:15	jn__	how they are implemented can be seen in compiler output and libc implementation
2020-12-25 04:23:57	Guest20	thanks jn__ Hello71
2020-12-25 04:24:06	jn__	as a bit of a side note, there is also a specific data structure in computer science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)
2020-12-25 04:24:06	jn__	but don't expect the "heap" of a C program etc. to be implemented as that kind of heap. it often isn't
2020-12-25 04:24:28	jn__	there is also a specific data structure *called a heap* in computer science
2020-12-25 04:24:44	Guest20	sure
2020-12-25 04:25:57	Guest20	i have one silly doubt, when a parent issues a fork(), it also issues a wait().. now this terminology is called "child is reaped"
2020-12-25 04:27:41	Guest20	wait() is called on a parent process just to delay its execution, so that child can execute and return its return status to the parent?
2020-12-25 04:27:45	Guest20	am i right?
2020-12-25 04:28:18	jn__	there is another aspect to it:
2020-12-25 04:29:08	jn__	before wait() has been called for a terminated process (a "zombie"), the kernel has to keep some information about the process around
2020-12-25 04:30:09	jn__	it can only free delete that information when the parent process calls wait
2020-12-25 04:31:20	jn__	note also that wait isn't called "so that child can execute". the child process can execute before the parent process ever calls wait.

2020-12-25 04:31:28	Guest20	i am confused with your first statement, do you mean even before wait(), there is a chance that child process can finish its execution and not return its return status to its parent?

2020-12-25 04:31:41	Hello71	Guest20: you can write your own program to test
2020-12-25 04:31:53	jn__	yes, the child process can start executing as soon as fork is called
2020-12-25 04:31:55	Hello71	the point of fork is that the parent and child can execute independently
2020-12-25 04:32:16	Hello71	on an SMP system they may in fact execute simultaneously
2020-12-25 04:32:22	jn__	Hello71 makes a great point. testing these details is a fun and educational way to learn about the system
2020-12-25 04:32:42	Guest20	jn__ so in the case , the parent will not free the information from the process table. this is called as zombie
2020-12-25 04:32:50	Hello71	although I suspect that in practice Linux will run the child briefly to see what it does, and only move it if both need CPU
2020-12-25 04:33:56	jn__	Guest20: a zombie is a process that has been terminated, but for which wait has not yet been called

2020-12-25 09:55:51	jungdongho	hello, is there any reference about which causes contribute how much to linux kernel crash/bug? like a _device drivers are primary contributor to kernel crashed_ from "Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems". But I couldn't find exact ratio and other causes.
2020-12-25 09:56:50	jungdongho	I searched arxiv and google scholar with keywords like linux, kernel, crash, bug, trend, ratio, etc... but couldn't find them
