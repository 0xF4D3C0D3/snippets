2020-12-19 06:51:20	grumplestiltzkin	Corona - youre supposed to cut around the bottle top (wine) so the foil comes off.   if youre pulling the cork through the foil like a savage, yeah, you deserve to drink the foil
2020-12-19 06:51:29	CableNinja	all of the rum I buy has stupid paper/foil wraps on their tops
2020-12-19 06:51:38	CableNinja	and are cork/plastic top of course
2020-12-19 06:52:42	Nightcinder	i am in need of a wine cork
2020-12-19 06:52:42	grumplestiltzkin	man - I quit drinking end of June - I'm getting so much more done at home now, and the extra cash is great.   I'm not going to evangalize it or anything - not regretting it though
2020-12-19 06:52:57	Nightcinder	i almost never drink, the money's nice but it goes into coffee

2020-12-19 06:58:49	CableNinja	I still drink, but not as much as I used to; a bottle of rum will last me a few days and then I dont drink again for another week or two

2020-12-19 07:00:21	grumplestiltzkin	yeah - I like when I have a constant supply of incoming buckets or bins of a standard type. I hobby organize
2020-12-19 07:00:54	CableNinja	I bought an industrial shelf unit from home depot to organize my car parts and other projects
2020-12-19 07:01:19	grumplestiltzkin	yeah, gorilla racks are nice
2020-12-19 07:01:37	CableNinja	unfortunately my place is so small, it takes up a lot of room... 
2020-12-19 07:02:16	b1	IS IT FRIDAY???
2020-12-19 07:02:23	CableNinja	FRIDAY FRIDAY
2020-12-19 07:02:34	enix	go ree laaaa
2020-12-19 07:02:44	enix	It's fucking Friday gentlemen
2020-12-19 07:02:50	enix	Thank god for that
2020-12-19 07:03:13	CableNinja	indeed. it was payday too... too bad its all pretty much gone already
2020-12-19 07:03:22	grumplestiltzkin	OH - bigtime, check out pricing on storage units in your area. Just on a whim I was looking a few months back and ermahgerd, jackpot. I caught not the bottom of the lowest prices ever, but *just* starting to upswing.   ehh..  what was it.  15 ft  ... yeah 10x15 ft units, like $30/mo ish
2020-12-19 07:03:43	grumplestiltzkin	wait no, that was it, $35/mo.   if I had been a week earlier, it would have been $25
2020-12-19 07:03:52	CableNinja	they are expensive here, and they all have stupid restrictions on use
2020-12-19 07:04:13	CableNinja	my 10x15 when I moved out here was like 85/mo
2020-12-19 07:04:20	grumplestiltzkin	usually around 80-100 for that size.  i grabbed a few.  the price can go up, but only either 4% or 10% per year/.
2020-12-19 07:05:11	grumplestiltzkin	and 2 of the ones I picked up are side by side, and happen to have an electric outlet between them.  (therse are basic storage, no power or lights, but ther outlet is very convenient
2020-12-19 07:05:43	grumplestiltzkin	getting the bulik of stuff out was totally worth it, storage space is *SO* much cheaper than living space
2020-12-19 07:05:44	enix	I have 8 failed disks.
2020-12-19 07:05:46	enix	EIGHT.
2020-12-19 07:06:03	CableNinja	I've just learned that if its gonna go in a storage unit, I probably dont need it. Everything on my shelf right now is either parts I've removed, or parts about to go on when I have time, other than the other projects on the workbench shelf level
2020-12-19 07:06:06	CableNinja	jfc enix
2020-12-19 07:06:13	grumplestiltzkin	and I need to still go through a *lot8 of boxes of stuff from the last few decades.   the storage unit takes the pressure off while I shuffle
2020-12-19 07:06:14	CableNinja	dont even breathe on it
2020-12-19 07:06:46	grumplestiltzkin	enix, put it in a deep freeze and BACK UP EVERYTHING, right meow
2020-12-19 07:07:10	enix	it crashedw hile taking a backup T_T
2020-12-19 07:07:17	CableNinja	heh
2020-12-19 07:07:21	CableNinja	ON A FRIDAY TOO
2020-12-19 07:09:14	grumplestiltzkin	or.. alternatively. is your resume current?
2020-12-19 07:10:30	CableNinja	lol

2020-12-19 07:10:58	enix	That's actually the current situation

2020-12-19 07:13:15	enix	I've had multiple disks fail at once before
2020-12-19 07:13:44	enix	I mean these things are built to near perfection in the exact same way every single time - if you buy all your disks all at once from the same batch, there's a really good chance they're all going to fail simultaneously 
2020-12-19 07:13:49	<--	Newami (~Newami@ip70-179-45-125.sd.sd.cox.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2020-12-19 07:14:36	CableNinja	yep; thats why you buy disks separate and either require they be from different batches, or ensure it happens by having 2+ vendors
2020-12-19 07:15:43	CableNinja	when I was in hosting we used to randomly stack the new drives together from each vendor so it was always a mix
2020-12-19 07:15:45	enix	i think my boss sorts by price and just mass buys the cheapies
2020-12-19 07:15:59	CableNinja	of course they do, thats why you have to specify
2020-12-19 07:16:10	CableNinja	and always provide 3 options
2020-12-19 07:16:17	enix	holy fucking shit

2020-12-19 07:18:12	CableNinja	I'd say go buy a lottery ticket, but I think you just used up all your friday luck, you'll probably be hit by a falling airplane that struck a bird which got struck by lightning on the way home
2020-12-19 07:18:15	enix	and also my backup system is "on the way"

2020-12-19 07:53:19	enix	what novelty? it runs an application in it's own little environment
2020-12-19 07:53:19	+s-d	<x​yz> still think it has its uses though
2020-12-19 07:53:21	enix	it's handy af
2020-12-19 07:53:39	+s-d	<x​yz> yeah but you need to install a docker server
2020-12-19 07:53:45	+s-d	<x​yz> which is big
2020-12-19 07:53:45	enix	yum -y install docker

2020-12-19 07:57:30	enix	I can tell you though we used it for huge projects serving millions of customers
2020-12-19 07:59:51	enix	My docker server is running four copies of Ark, a few copies of srcds, shapez.io and a bunch of other utils for things like chat etc. and it's at around 150GB
2020-12-19 08:00:23	enix	Docker itself is around 200MB I think
2020-12-19 08:00:45	enix	images are like 200MB
2020-12-19 08:02:21	enix	Anyway what I'm saying is that it's really good if you want to wrap an application up in it's own little environment and be able to scale apps that support doing so. The overhead of docker for cpu/ram/disk is negligible and the disk usage is less than installing a minimal server OS, and it all just 'runs' which also good.
2020-12-19 08:03:21	enix	I've also scripted my containers to ping our discord server on reboot, then self-update with mods when they come back up and ping discord when it's running again

2020-12-19 12:17:35	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I tend to like shitty tea like lipton

2020-12-19 12:18:10	corona266	only one i've tried before is laoshu dianhong and it is now my favorite tea. great mellow flavor, minor floral notes, clear caffeine high
2020-12-19 12:18:24	corona266	the puer's are supposed to be top tier quality
2020-12-19 12:18:40	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> yea I know jack all about tea

2020-12-19 12:18:52	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I should make a flavored beverage of my own

2020-12-19 12:20:18	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> it was my "god I want booze" drink for 4-5mo

2020-12-19 12:21:59	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> i'm on the 3rd floor, I was holding 4 canisters to go exchange, didn't see a shitty fake wig on the stairs

2020-12-19 12:27:19	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> because the article is missing half the stuff

2020-12-19 12:38:54	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> and absorb a little info?

2020-12-19 12:39:46	corona266	no we run pytorch internally because of a 6 mo turn around for projects and all the testing and angles involved
2020-12-19 12:40:13	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> i've seen pytorch, whats the difference between it and keras?
2020-12-19 12:40:32	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> the article I read either didn't say much or I didn't understand
2020-12-19 12:40:36	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> probably the latter
2020-12-19 12:40:44	corona266	tensorflow/keras was a different beast back in 1.x
2020-12-19 12:41:01	corona266	you had to basically program everything and hope that it worked without interactive debugging
2020-12-19 12:41:16	corona266	it may be more similar now, but I really haven't touched it
2020-12-19 12:41:31	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> ah
2020-12-19 12:41:32	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> well
2020-12-19 12:41:33	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> i'll see
2020-12-19 12:41:48	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> if nothing else this book will let me learn some
2020-12-19 12:41:56	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> even if I have to drop tf/keras
2020-12-19 12:42:22	corona266	pytorch you can drop a pdb in the middle of a model and it'll halt so you can step through
2020-12-19 12:43:01	corona266	as far as that board? no idea. we don't run on dedicated boards, we have servers for that
2020-12-19 12:43:19	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> oh yea
2020-12-19 12:43:28	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I just have connections in that industry
2020-12-19 12:43:43	corona266	nice, hit em up
2020-12-19 12:43:44	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> so I was seeing if xilinx had any accelerator cards for building the model

2020-12-20 04:37:54	rpifan	What did u do in there
2020-12-20 04:41:16	@SantaGibby	depends on the size/type of datacenter rpifan. Remote hands (fixing simple shit) for clients, swapping drives, take out old gear, rack and stack, run cables from rack to rack, lots of labeling/documentation

2020-12-20 04:47:33	+s-d	<c​orona266> maybe even less
2020-12-20 04:56:54	+s-d	<j​ohnny lawrence> at the place i worked last, the datacenter specialists were deliberately non-technical software-wise (relative to your average sysadmin). the hardware skills they picked up were mostly learned on the job from the vets
2020-12-20 05:05:10	@SantaGibby	it requires you to be able to walk and move shit, no real technical experience
2020-12-20 05:07:18	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Sounds like what I was doing
2020-12-20 05:07:22	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Mostly rack and stack, and DC power.
2020-12-20 05:08:15	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Although the DC end was mostly figured out for me. I just ran what they told me to run
2020-12-20 05:09:05	misspwn	you don't want to work in a data center
2020-12-20 05:09:22	misspwn	you won't learn a whole lot
2020-12-20 05:09:57	DrJazepSazyc	DC tech is really the lowest job in IT
2020-12-20 05:10:11	rpifan	That's sad
2020-12-20 05:10:16	DrJazepSazyc	How so?
2020-12-20 05:10:22	DrJazepSazyc	it's just not a very skilled job
2020-12-20 05:10:28	+s-d	<d​eized> help desk is
2020-12-20 05:10:33	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> It was a step up for me from Tech Support, haha
2020-12-20 05:10:35	DrJazepSazyc	no, not at all
2020-12-20 05:10:45	DrJazepSazyc	On help desk, you learn stuff
2020-12-20 05:10:54	DrJazepSazyc	DC tech you do the same shit every every day
2020-12-20 05:11:04	rpifan	Hm
2020-12-20 05:11:04	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I'd say it depends
2020-12-20 05:11:33	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> as a DC tech you can take the time to learn about architecture, but I guess that depends on who you work for
2020-12-20 05:11:43	DrJazepSazyc	not really
2020-12-20 05:11:49	DrJazepSazyc	architecture these days is all in the Cloud
2020-12-20 05:11:51	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I.E. I did have a few times where I had to design and layout small rooms of racks.
2020-12-20 05:12:16	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> and do some measurements for fiber trays
2020-12-20 05:12:28	DrJazepSazyc	wot lol
2020-12-20 05:12:41	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I was working for an ISP. We had a lot of data centers, colos, etc.
2020-12-20 05:12:59	DrJazepSazyc	Sure, but I wouldn't say that immensely valuable to learn
2020-12-20 05:13:09	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I'm just saying it depends. It's situational.
2020-12-20 05:13:16	DrJazepSazyc	Sure
2020-12-20 05:13:30	DrJazepSazyc	I'm stuck on help desk but I live in a poor country, so it's no problem
2020-12-20 05:13:35	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> If your goal is to sit at a desk with AD all day, no, those skills are probably useless.
2020-12-20 05:13:39	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> lol
2020-12-20 05:14:14	DrJazepSazyc	I'm probably in the top 5% of my poor little country doing remote help desk
2020-12-20 05:14:33	DrJazepSazyc	although there is some sysadmin + programming involved too
2020-12-20 05:14:38	DrJazepSazyc	but mostly help desk
2020-12-20 05:14:51	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> One day, you too can be management (commercial voice)
2020-12-20 05:14:57	DrJazepSazyc	haha yeah
2020-12-20 05:16:15	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I hated dealing with DC power though.
2020-12-20 05:16:42	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Watching dumbasses plug AC power into DC devices
2020-12-20 05:16:50	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Dealing with people using the wrong lugs

2020-12-21 02:21:13	ihre	well yeah he doesn't 'relay' registered users
2020-12-21 02:21:30	ihre	@<discordnick> works iirc

2020-12-21 02:24:14	--	mistiry_ is now known as mistiry
2020-12-21 02:24:22	catbeard	thought you were trying to tab complete "mistiry"
2020-12-21 02:24:23	catbeard	lol
2020-12-21 02:24:31	ogo	no <mistry> that one is not highlighted (at least not fully, only s-d's own nick is in bold green which is my setting for highlights, the rest of the message is in ordinary formatting)
2020-12-21 02:24:53	catbeard	so it is setting off highlights, just gets the formatting wrong
2020-12-21 02:25:10	catbeard	because it expects the first word to be the message, when in this case it's the nick messaging through s-d/Discord bridge
2020-12-21 02:25:41	ogo	yes, i think so. because hexchat did flash a tiny window when the message from mistiry arrived so that bit is also good
2020-12-21 02:25:45	catbeard	so for s-d, you'd have to adjust your highlight script to recognized based on the 2nd term on (but only from s-d)
2020-12-21 02:26:39	catbeard	or mistiry maybe you could try formatting it different, like
2020-12-21 02:26:42	mistiry	it may just be settings. hexchat should be able to highlight if your nick is mentioned anywhere in the text
2020-12-21 02:26:46	ihre	would you rather.... work for an msp which is not great but seems to provide nice careergrowth longer term or work for a startup, the latter pays more but in terms of growth within the company, there isnt a whole lot of potential i think

2020-12-21 02:27:14	mistiry	nick at the end is a bad idea
2020-12-21 02:27:25	catbeard	can be color formatted or w/e
2020-12-21 02:27:29	mistiry	if someone posts a long message that gets truncated we'd not see their nick
2020-12-21 02:27:35	catbeard	ah true
2020-12-21 02:27:37	ihre	s/n/d
2020-12-21 02:27:38	l8	mistiry meant: "if someode posts a lodg message that gets trudcated we'd dot see their dick"
2020-12-21 02:27:39	mistiry	it is currently already color-formatted
2020-12-21 02:27:45	ihre	hm
2020-12-21 02:27:46	ihre	close
2020-12-21 02:27:56	catbeard	could split the text into multiple lines
2020-12-21 02:27:57	ihre	such a 12yrold
2020-12-21 02:27:58	mistiry	the s-d bot colorizes the discord nickname
2020-12-21 02:28:05	catbeard	if chars >= 100 or something
2020-12-21 02:28:18	catbeard	and author sign each line
2020-12-21 02:28:29	catbeard	but that should fix the first-word highlight detection
2020-12-21 02:28:38	catbeard	usually highlights occur at the beginning of a line
2020-12-21 02:28:56	mistiry	plenty of highlights happen mid-sentenece
2020-12-21 02:29:13	catbeard	hmm
2020-12-21 02:29:21	mistiry	and one person has complained about it, even though it did highlight them in the client
2020-12-21 02:29:33	mistiry	its just their settings for how it stylizes the text in a highlighted message, im guessing
2020-12-21 02:29:35	catbeard	ogo: did it notify you that 's-d' highlighted you at least?
2020-12-21 02:29:59	catbeard	when mistiry highlighted you from discord?
2020-12-21 02:31:13	catbeard	probably won't be an easy way to figure out "who" highlighted you, but at least you'll know you were highlighted, and you'd just have to scroll back to see it
2020-12-21 02:31:50	catbeard	unless you maybe log your highlights to a separate buffer or something so you can see the message too
2020-12-21 02:32:04	catbeard	been so long since i used hexchat
2020-12-21 02:32:19	catbeard	can't remember if it only shows you the nick that highlighted

2020-12-21 02:43:21	catbeard	if you do ec2 though, highly advised that you setup the sqlite3 delete timestamp script, so that your logs don't fill /, on ec2, that's a whoooole separate reach-around for fixing that (on RHEL at least)
2020-12-21 02:45:04	catbeard	it involves setting up another instance and mounting the disk to that (detach from existing, reattach to new), boot into that and parted, shut down, detach from new, reattach to original, remove the new instance and the disk backup
2020-12-21 02:45:20	ihre	you've just mentioned plenty of excuses not to do it

2020-12-21 02:52:47	catbeard	which you can vary at will
2020-12-21 02:53:08	ihre	should probably work that out

2020-12-21 03:11:51	ihre	also just curious
2020-12-21 03:11:58	ihre	why are you building a webshop yourself?
2020-12-21 03:12:14	jimender2	Wonder if it would be better to integrate it vs just throw up a small webshop to purchase "clicks"
2020-12-21 03:12:58	ihre	instead of picking something like woocommerce/magento/wordpress/??? 
2020-12-21 03:13:22	jimender2	I have an AI image analyzer that we are trying to monetize and they decided on a per 'click' usage.  Trying to make it easy on me.
2020-12-21 03:14:11	ihre	gotcha, basically a paywall kind of thingy

2020-12-21 03:22:04	jimender2	it is scarily accurate

2020-12-21 03:22:41	ihre	as in, does everyone from a company submit its photo
2020-12-21 03:22:48	jimender2	you can also use it to see the likelyhood to see if someone will buy your product or agree with you. 
2020-12-21 03:22:53	shibboleth	facial detection?

2020-12-21 03:28:54	jimender2	the best part of this is that it was a zoom (or similar) meeting so we could do that.  We could also just use a random posed photo of someone (think linkedin)
2020-12-21 03:29:13	ihre	jimender2: i wonder though, the hiring processes I've been through were quite thorough, multiple stages with interviews and technical assessments
2020-12-21 03:29:24	ihre	maybe its a gatekeeper at the first stage?
2020-12-21 03:29:35	ihre	similar to how email filters can be applied, idk
2020-12-21 03:29:52	shibboleth	heh... you did analysis of the biometrics of participants in a zune-meeting?
2020-12-21 03:29:58	jimender2	they got their hands on it during the final stages but yeah it would be good for gatekeeping
2020-12-21 03:30:21	shibboleth	you know... you'll get hanged in the town square for doing that in europe...
2020-12-21 03:31:00	ihre	if you integrate it into your hiring process, i suppose you might
2020-12-21 03:31:08	shibboleth	ehm
2020-12-21 03:31:24	shibboleth	they gave informed consent to you handling their biometrics as part of hiring?

2020-12-21 05:52:03	signofzeta	Hello, macplus.  I used to own a Macintosh Plus.  Fun little machine.
2020-12-21 05:52:33	macplus	im actually on a macplus
2020-12-21 05:52:43	catbeard	never would have guessed

2020-12-21 05:53:06	macplus	thru a lot of time and fucking around tbh
2020-12-21 05:53:30	macplus	i used a localtalk adapter and connected it to a pi and then used the pi to route the localtalk to my wifi

2020-12-21 05:54:38	signofzeta	good job, macplus.  so you're basically using a serial terminal on the Plus?
2020-12-21 05:54:40	macplus	i have it in my kitchen as a recipe computer.
2020-12-21 05:54:45	macplus	yeah
2020-12-21 05:54:52	signofzeta	I've heard of people using Ethernet cards in the SE/30's PDS slot, but that's not available on the Plus.
2020-12-21 05:55:03	macplus	@33.6k the "dial up" script just does a linux login over a tty
2020-12-21 05:55:13	signofzeta	There was one guy who wrote a crude Wi-Fi driver for classic macOS, but that's a whole other can of worms.

2020-12-21 06:09:13	signofzeta	*then ARM
2020-12-21 06:09:37	catbeard	by Intel  you mean IA32 e.g.?
2020-12-21 06:09:46	catbeard	or x86
2020-12-21 06:10:10	signofzeta	Yes, Apple used m68k, then ppc, then ppc64, then x86, then x86_64, and now I'm guessing it's arm64

2020-12-21 06:12:37	signofzeta	Supposedly, Apple designed their chips to have hardware support for JavaScript instructions.  So the reviewers say.

2020-12-22 06:21:15	CableNinja	it was WAY stronger
2020-12-22 06:21:28	DeepSpaceK9	Monster Ultra still has caffeine, but probably closer to a cup of coffee or something
2020-12-22 06:21:36	int0x1C8	pervitin?
2020-12-22 06:21:44	int0x1C8	(lol)
2020-12-22 06:21:44	mittens	Ahhh ok. Sometimes folks say that about ADHD meds and it makes me sound like a crackhead and I'm not a fan of that :P
2020-12-22 06:22:16	CableNinja	140mg Caffeine per Can, B12 says '490% DV'
2020-12-22 06:22:33	DeepSpaceK9	I know a lot of people who take Adderall in the restaurant industry because they get paid garbage and going full force is the only way they can make enough to put food on the table. :|
2020-12-22 06:22:43	CableNinja	mittens, nah, he was basically a crackhead; when he talked you could totally tell how spazzed he was
2020-12-22 06:23:34	DeepSpaceK9	Me... I already want to smack people. I don't need any drugs. LOL
2020-12-22 06:23:40	CableNinja	so 140mg is like 2 cups of coffee, but 'cup' seems subjective

2020-12-22 06:24:10	DeepSpaceK9	Yeah I never worked in a restaurant
2020-12-22 06:24:25	CableNinja	I worked in a schlotzskys and everyone was high on something; half the crew went out to the drivethru box before shift and smoked
2020-12-22 06:24:28	DeepSpaceK9	Closest I came was to McDonalds for about 2 weeks before I walked out because they were shoving 60-70 hr weeks on me while I was a full-time student
2020-12-22 06:24:32	DeepSpaceK9	I did NOT have enough drugs for THAT

2020-12-22 06:56:32	mittens	Ahhh good deal. Each and every time I had a customer with phone issues (I worked NOC at a CLEC), it was due to NAT shit.

2020-12-22 07:00:44	mittens	Honestly just ask them what the biggest bottlenecks are in the pipeline and get to it!
2020-12-22 07:01:11	Steeve	do you think it would be wrong to tell them their application sucks shit and they should learn how to design programs
2020-12-22 07:01:17	Steeve	kidding    sigh
2020-12-22 07:01:34	Steeve	thanks, that's helpful, will continue to just try to demonstrate that i'm.... here to help engineer
2020-12-22 07:01:42	mittens	And instead of pushing tech on them, ask how they feel about xyz tech and or throw a POC at them to test 'er out... afterall, you're job is to augment the pipeline and platform to make their lives easier.
2020-12-22 07:01:44	Steeve	not push reponsibility onto 'the other team'
2020-12-22 07:01:51	mittens	lmfao
2020-12-22 07:01:51	Steeve	for sure
2020-12-22 07:02:22	Steeve	i could be 100% wrong but i feel like maybe there is a slight culture of fear...like where nobody wants to be responsible for problems
2020-12-22 07:02:30	Steeve	so everyone is poised to say 'you did it'
2020-12-22 07:02:40	mittens	Yikes... that's no bueno.
2020-12-22 07:03:26	mittens	'Being an owner' is one of our core tenants and I think we follow it pretty well. Folks are encouraged to take ownership and become a go-to person for systems.
2020-12-22 07:03:33	Steeve	yeah
2020-12-22 07:03:34	Steeve	i like that
2020-12-22 07:04:02	mittens	And of course the usual 'blameless post-mortems' is a key thing... some folks don't realize that it's literally an opportunity for collective learning which is awesome.
2020-12-22 07:04:20	Steeve	absolutely
2020-12-22 07:04:24	Steeve	i actually like....engineering
2020-12-22 07:04:32	mittens	Level up the hivemind as a whole ya know? Even folks not directly involved can have takeaways.
2020-12-22 07:04:35	mittens	lolol yep
2020-12-22 07:05:02	mittens	Actually, when we declare an outage, every single team's on-call engineer is pinged and pulled into a Zoom/Slack room to chat (even those teams not directly involved).
2020-12-22 07:05:03	Steeve	love it
2020-12-22 07:05:55	mittens	Gives a chance for everyone to take a peek at it. We have a tendency for folks that aren't involved to dive in anyways. Then maybe they see something others may not, etc.
2020-12-22 07:06:23	Steeve	Yeah that kind of approach works well for me too
2020-12-22 07:06:36	Steeve	I LOVE sharing my stuff, or discussing, if someone wants to learn
2020-12-22 07:06:41	mittens	idk I think it's a pride thing involved as well. You should want to tackle the shit for the organization as a whole.
2020-12-22 07:06:52	mittens	Yeah no doubt!
2020-12-22 07:07:04	Steeve	and i like learning other new things

2020-12-22 07:09:39	Steeve	yeah that's *so* relevant to me, and something i need to do too

2020-12-22 07:10:43	mittens	We have a few teams that split that up: my team works on the VM infra, a more senior team is on our k8s clusters, and another one focused on build pipeline.
2020-12-22 07:11:23	mittens	Absolutely, everyday :P We're mainly a Ruby (Chef) and Go shop.

2020-12-22 07:12:14	mittens	We're pretty much expected to be able to pick up languages on the fly and roll stuff out.
2020-12-22 07:12:35	Steeve	That has to be so helpful to the team/organization as a whole
2020-12-22 07:12:45	Steeve	to have the ops/admin people be able to think in that way
2020-12-22 07:12:53	Steeve	and share some of the terminology
2020-12-22 07:12:58	Steeve	and design patterns
2020-12-22 07:13:31	mittens	Yepyep for sure. I mean, we provide the platform so it's ultimately up to the devs to use it properly and not our responsibility for their use/misuse of it... but we also need to be able to dive into the dev's code and help them debug if need be.
2020-12-22 07:13:46	Steeve	oh interesting
2020-12-22 07:13:51	Steeve	is that something unique to your org?
2020-12-22 07:13:57	Steeve	helping them debug
2020-12-22 07:17:10	mittens	Ahhh nope! We have a dedicated 'ops questions' channel where folks can ask questions and really anyone with free time can dive in and help out.
2020-12-22 07:17:39	Steeve	That's so interesting
2020-12-22 07:17:54	Steeve	So the Ops crew is expected to be as proficient as dedicated developers?
2020-12-22 07:18:06	Steeve	or just like little helper elves in times of need?

2020-12-22 07:18:36	mittens	To an extent. We probably write a bit more kludge than the dev teams but we get by :P
2020-12-22 07:19:01	Steeve	i hope they make the devs learn linux too
2020-12-22 07:19:04	Steeve	$$$
2020-12-22 07:19:22	Steeve	man...what i wouldn't give for some of the PHP developers i've worked with to know a little about linux systems
2020-12-22 07:19:37	mittens	But yeah our guys are making PR's to Go stuff in k8s/terraform and even shit like C with logrotate. If it's an issue and a code one, we are expected to write code to fix it.
2020-12-22 07:19:53	Steeve	that's great
2020-12-22 07:19:59	Steeve	and so nice to have in your skillset
2020-12-22 07:22:50	mittens	Yeah for sure! For example, our entire VM infra is homegrown. My team maintains the portal (Rails application) and agents running on KVMs (Ruby/Go+libvirt) that devs use to fire up new VM's. So basically the whole infra stack is written by us.
2020-12-22 07:23:10	Steeve	oh how neat
2020-12-22 07:23:50	mittens	Gives us nice tight-knit control over it all rather than slapping on some premade solution that would require tinkering to adjust to our needs.
2020-12-22 07:24:01	Steeve	for sure

2020-12-22 07:37:21	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> So something is misconfigured on that Agent's modem/router. Mittens: I plugged the phone in at home, netgear modem, netgear router... worked plug-and-play.

2020-12-22 07:46:37	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I walked him through everything on the physical end and it checked out. I even had him disable SIP ALG. But something's not right. Either the agent is lying about skipping something or something is just misconfigured.
2020-12-22 07:48:04	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I'm leaning towards misconfigured TBH
2020-12-22 07:49:26	mittens	Sounds like a PEBKAC issue :P

2020-12-22 07:50:01	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Well, yes, but let's be fair. I don't expect the agents to be at high IT level.

2020-12-22 07:52:34	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Shouldn't be necessary though.
2020-12-22 07:53:24	CableNinja	did they get the network cable for the phone from you/with the phone, or is the cable one of theirs
2020-12-22 07:53:35	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> From me. Two of them, to be exact.

2020-12-22 08:11:10	CableNinja	nah
2020-12-22 08:11:14	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> My idea of DC work was replacing physical tapes for backups, replacing HDDS, rack and stack, monitoring, that sort've thing
2020-12-22 08:11:40	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> I did not expect to be running 1/0 copper wire and installing 300+ AMP equipment.
2020-12-22 08:11:41	jay-ros	cable runs all day DSK9
2020-12-22 08:11:41	CableNinja	even the scrawny kid could load a rack full as long as they werent 3U
2020-12-22 08:12:06	mittens	lmfao pinged my boss while he's out just for him to read whenever he's free... he goes and changes his Slack status to a X. Whoopsies.

2020-12-22 08:12:37	mittens	This is why we always request 2 techs when we intake :P

2020-12-22 08:13:16	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> My CEO was freaking out about the standard trial ending

2020-12-22 08:13:28	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> ... but we don't use any of the features that's tied to standard.
2020-12-22 08:14:11	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Also Zoom is the only reason I got one particular agent running today
2020-12-22 08:14:19	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> SHE PUT THE USB KEYBOARD INTO THE ETHERNET PORT ON HER PHONE

2020-12-22 08:14:23	CableNinja	dude calls me telling me his email isnt working, so I say I'll get to it first thing in the morning. morning rolls around and I didnt even contact him, I just assumed he was aware I'd be on at the start of the morning... well.. he forgot, and was spankin it to tiny penis bondage porn in full screen
2020-12-22 08:14:31	mittens	Only thing to freak about it losing message retention... I _think_ we have it on ours to only retain messages for ~1 year and already I think that's not enough.
2020-12-22 08:15:09	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> We don't need it to retain messages like that
2020-12-22 08:15:25	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> We don't use Slack for anything fancy like making tickets or really important convos.
2020-12-22 08:15:36	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> It's more for going, hey, get into this gotomeeting chat, or silly daily quotes.
2020-12-22 08:17:05	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Sometimes a congrats if an Agent does something good.
2020-12-22 08:17:25	catbeard	monitoring alerts and workflow authorization mostly
2020-12-22 08:18:03	mittens	^ Primary comms, alerts/pagerduty integrations, custom slash commands for creating repos or declaring outages, etc.
2020-12-22 08:18:22	+s-d	<D​eep Space K9> Yeah you two have much more of a use case than we do haha
2020-12-22 08:18:23	mittens	Bread and butter. Slack is love.
2020-12-22 08:18:48	catbeard	slack just doubled their bug bounty payouts

2020-12-22 10:14:06	JollyRgrs	some ppl ride cars until they die
2020-12-22 10:14:14	JollyRgrs	others try to stay atop and change every few years
2020-12-22 10:14:40	enix	what car
2020-12-22 10:14:43	Jaelae	Yea I’m debating it
2020-12-22 10:14:54	Jaelae	This is my family mobile 2016 Honda Pilot
2020-12-22 10:15:56	csws	tfw Exchange Online now giving "Unlimited" for RecipientLimit on Get-Mailbox. Broke a janky application
2020-12-22 10:15:59	Jaelae	In 2022 it’s paid off or I can sell it now while it has a pretty damn high value still and switch to a leasing mindset . I’d be paying $300 less per month and figured I’d just start putting that money into savings for a future lease . Better do some calculations
2020-12-22 10:16:21	enix	if you're looking to sell off at prime time, it's when the price and desirability is still high and market is not flooded
2020-12-22 10:16:34	enix	so now sounds like a good idea, presuming theres no huge exit fee
2020-12-22 10:16:56	JollyRgrs	Jaelae: yeah, i'd say ride it until it dies (it's a honda, it'll last a while) and keep "paying" for it after it is paid off, into savings
2020-12-22 10:17:17	enix	some places offer guaranteed trade-in values too which are often pretty good
2020-12-22 10:17:29	enix	iirc it worked out well constantly trading up with lexus
2020-12-22 10:17:33	JollyRgrs	just don't tell them you plan to trade in until they settle on teh price of the new car
2020-12-22 10:18:02	cryptic1	yeah ride till it does
2020-12-22 10:18:05	cryptic1	die 
2020-12-22 10:18:27	cryptic1	which will be a loooong time if you do maintenance 
2020-12-22 10:18:30	Jaelae	That’s the considerations I used carvana and others to get a value. I owe 19k and it will sell for $24500. But I think it will still have a high value in  a few years
2020-12-22 10:18:45	Jaelae	New car seems nice but maybe a bad move even with cheap leases
2020-12-22 10:18:59	cryptic1	new car is always a bad idea

2020-12-22 10:19:38	Jaelae	Well this is a 2016 pilot touring awd with 35,000 miles so it’s still valuable
2020-12-22 10:19:47	enix	csws: thats just smart. Subarus are the best cars on the road
2020-12-22 10:19:53	cryptic1	thats no miles

2020-12-22 10:20:09	csws	honda might be ok. depends on the year I guess
2020-12-22 10:20:15	enix	noones cruising a pilot because they think it looks cool
2020-12-22 10:20:23	technonerd	just buy a toyoda
2020-12-22 10:20:27	technonerd	drive into ground
2020-12-22 10:20:33	Jaelae	Yea mdx is the cooler variety and now mdx lease is the same cost lol
2020-12-22 10:20:35	enix	the ILX looks nice
2020-12-22 10:21:08	Jaelae	Ilx is great so far - it’s a luxuryish Honda Civic
2020-12-22 10:21:09	enix	just buy a tesla
2020-12-22 10:21:11	Jaelae	But cheaper
2020-12-22 10:22:10	enix	part of my self evaluation is to list what tasks in my job description are still relevant
2020-12-22 10:22:15	enix	I dont have a JD
2020-12-22 10:22:18	enix	so thats awkward

2020-12-22 20:22:19	teh_f4ll3n	I see what you're doing there. I think :D
2020-12-22 20:22:39	+s-d	<G​ene> converting 123 -  {1,2,3}
2020-12-22 20:22:42	teh_f4ll3n	yup
2020-12-22 20:23:02	teh_f4ll3n	converting a number into a string of digits
2020-12-22 20:23:32	+s-d	<G​ene> not really.
2020-12-22 20:23:39	+s-d	<G​ene> that'd be 123 -  "123" 😛
2020-12-22 20:23:53	teh_f4ll3n	ok, array?
2020-12-22 20:23:56	+s-d	<G​ene> yes.
2020-12-22 20:24:04	+s-d	<G​ene> an array, which is called a "slice" in golang for some reason.
2020-12-22 20:24:57	+s-d	<G​ene> https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro
2020-12-22 20:24:57	+s-d	<G​ene> 
2020-12-22 20:24:57	+s-d	<G​ene> Actually, kinda has both.
2020-12-22 20:25:02	teh_f4ll3n	I used "string" because you're doing that sequentially without reordering them from what I can tell
2020-12-22 20:25:05	+s-d	<G​ene> array = fixed length, slice = no fixed length.
2020-12-22 20:25:25	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, it's still a slice of ints, it's not a string type.
2020-12-22 20:25:45	teh_f4ll3n	wasn't talking about type :)
2020-12-22 20:26:02	teh_f4ll3n	"string" as in a set of symbols
2020-12-22 20:26:18	teh_f4ll3n	not a programming term in my use case
2020-12-22 20:26:19	teh_f4ll3n	:D
2020-12-22 20:26:29	+s-d	<G​ene> confusing to say the least.
2020-12-22 20:26:33	teh_f4ll3n	i really don't like dev
2020-12-22 20:26:35	teh_f4ll3n	yup
2020-12-22 20:26:50	teh_f4ll3n	should have just said array
2020-12-22 20:26:51	+s-d	<G​ene> i'd probably move to dev tbh, more jobs available, better pay than ops.
2020-12-22 20:27:41	teh_f4ll3n	whatever floats your boat and gets the bills paid
2020-12-22 20:27:58	teh_f4ll3n	not gonna judge
2020-12-22 20:28:00	+s-d	<G​ene> ops seems way more stressful than dev tbh.

2020-12-22 20:28:13	nobyk	perfect mix
2020-12-22 20:28:27	teh_f4ll3n	still has "dev" in the name
2020-12-22 20:28:28	+s-d	<G​ene> also, 2 salaries, 1 job, rite?
2020-12-22 20:28:34	nobyk	yeye

2020-12-22 20:28:39	teh_f4ll3n	lol
2020-12-22 20:28:45	teh_f4ll3n	you wish!
2020-12-22 20:29:00	teh_f4ll3n	1 salary double the requirements
2020-12-22 20:29:25	+s-d	<G​ene> it doubles ops pay, but only like 30-40% increase over dev pay
2020-12-22 20:29:35	+s-d	<G​ene> kinda crazy dev makes so much more than ops ._.
2020-12-22 20:29:54	teh_f4ll3n	dev is nothing without ops though :D

2020-12-22 20:30:28	teh_f4ll3n	still need ops at AWS :D
2020-12-22 20:30:39	+s-d	<G​ene> nah, lambda doesn't require ops afaik
2020-12-22 20:31:21	teh_f4ll3n	I understand YOU don't need ops for AWS, but AWS need ops to allow you to do what you need to
2020-12-22 20:31:37	+s-d	<G​ene> it's outsourced, as I said.

2020-12-22 23:44:15	teh_f4ll3n	fail2ban helps filtering brute force out. Not a firewall

2020-12-23 00:22:46	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> so I figured bind to Dev.whaterver.What's a safe local domain? or do I make the sysadmins register one?, and UAT.whatever and prod.whatever

2020-12-23 00:26:20	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I suck at networking for example
2020-12-23 00:26:21	+s-d	<x​yz> because ops is pretty much sysadmin these days
2020-12-23 00:26:36	teh_f4ll3n	as opposed the my predecessor who was "not an admin and didn't care enough not to build a shit system#"
2020-12-23 00:26:39	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> yes after the sysadmins spawn the VM its pretty much my territory

2020-12-23 00:28:37	+s-d	<x​yz> also @sunrunner20 if you have dev.domain.com then getting certs will also be easy

2020-12-23 00:28:49	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> yes i'll reuse the certs
2020-12-23 00:28:58	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I hate wildcard and i hate SAN
2020-12-23 00:29:11	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> SAN certs are a information disclosure vulerability IMHO
2020-12-23 00:29:13	teh_f4ll3n	wildcards are fine
2020-12-23 00:29:14	+s-d	<x​yz> SAN and wildcard is amaazing
2020-12-23 00:29:22	+s-d	<x​yz> it could be yes

2020-12-23 15:10:39	jay-ros	are you looking for anyone in the position of turning up 15 minutes late to work every day, running a few scripts to do all his work, then spending three hours making it look like he's busy researching how to do the work?
2020-12-23 15:11:29	jay-ros	then sits there and helps out his coworkers do their work at the same time, with some smarmy comments on them leaving fifteen minutes early like "half day, mate?"

2020-12-23 16:39:29	+s-d	<J​et> maybe hip hop isnt for you then..
2020-12-23 16:39:37	JollyRgrs	uh....
2020-12-23 16:41:11	JollyRgrs	i'm more into jurassic 5, chali 2na and most others you prob haven't heard of... yours was more of a "let me just spew curse words and try and tell a story inside the few words between" thing
2020-12-23 16:41:24	JollyRgrs	the hip hop i like is more thoughtful
2020-12-23 16:42:09	JollyRgrs	but just like saying "i like rock"
2020-12-23 16:42:18	JollyRgrs	there are many sub-genres in rock, and because you like one doesn't mean you like another
2020-12-23 16:42:28	JollyRgrs	i can like classic rock and not death metal, right?
2020-12-23 16:42:49	JollyRgrs	or you could like death metal and not alt. rock
2020-12-23 16:43:05	JollyRgrs	so maybe if you don't understand that, then hip hop isn't for you
2020-12-23 16:44:25	misspwn	damn JollyRgrs i got called out "mom, why are you giving me sink water?"
2020-12-23 16:44:52	JollyRgrs	WOW!

2020-12-23 16:45:15	misspwn	hahahaha
2020-12-23 16:45:24	JollyRgrs	is your water really hard/sulfur filled where you are at? or is it fairly good?
2020-12-23 16:45:44	misspwn	this was from our 3 year old too. our water is actually pretty decent, i'll admit it wasn't cold which i think is what he was meaning
2020-12-23 16:45:58	JollyRgrs	i mean, here our water is pretty hard (no sulfur here, so that's good)... but it's fine to drink from tap... if it is refridgerated or on ice, even better
2020-12-23 16:46:02	JollyRgrs	haha
2020-12-23 16:46:04	JollyRgrs	lets hope!

2020-12-23 16:46:56	JollyRgrs	i don't mind curse words, but when that's 50% of your vocab, how much are you really saying in your lyrics?
2020-12-23 16:47:19	JollyRgrs	it's just pointless at that point. waste of breath
2020-12-23 16:47:31	misspwn	you don't feel hardcore when you blast that in the burbs?
2020-12-23 16:47:36	JollyRgrs	if they have talent as lyricists, they can figure out more words to say

2020-12-23 17:25:52	JollyRgrs	if you have exp. certs don't mean much unless you work for an MSP
2020-12-23 17:26:20	JollyRgrs	focus more on just learning the stuff, not studying for the cert
2020-12-23 17:26:25	+s-d	<G​ene> i have nearly a decade of exp, but the titles from previous jobs didn't really imply sysadmin work; even though the duties def were sysadmin stuff.
2020-12-23 17:26:29	+s-d	<H​otmess> depends on the country:)
2020-12-23 17:26:40	JollyRgrs	@Gene, you don't only list titles, right?
2020-12-23 17:26:50	+s-d	<G​ene> nah, i include job descriptions and such.
2020-12-23 17:26:56	JollyRgrs	I barely pay attn to the title, I focus on what I did at the job that stands out that I want to highlight
2020-12-23 17:26:59	+s-d	<G​ene> but a "support specialist" sounds more like helldesk than actual sysadmin shit
2020-12-23 17:27:23	+s-d	<G​ene> doesn't help i'm trying to move into devops with zero "professional" dev exp
2020-12-23 17:27:29	JollyRgrs	also, I had some whack title at one job. for linkedin, I totally didn't use it b/c it didn't mean "SCCM admin" at all.... in fact, it had "analyst" in the title

2020-12-23 17:28:03	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, you use more than DSLs to do that most of the time.
2020-12-23 17:28:10	JollyRgrs	you do need to know how to do some scripting/coding though to get the job done
2020-12-23 17:28:13	+s-d	<G​ene> can't write powershell/python, probably not qualified for devops
2020-12-23 17:28:17	JollyRgrs	oh...
2020-12-23 17:28:30	JollyRgrs	yeah, if you can't write powershell scripts... you'd wanna focus on scripting first
2020-12-23 17:28:41	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, I can write those, i'm saying if someone can't.

2020-12-23 17:29:34	JollyRgrs	so long as you understand it enough with the help of the googs
2020-12-23 17:29:44	JollyRgrs	and you understand that it is a power that you CAN use, even if you have to spend some time on it
2020-12-23 17:29:45	+s-d	<G​ene> oh, with google, I'm fine with bash even
2020-12-23 17:29:59	JollyRgrs	you don't have to know how to use tools as much as know when, or that you can use said tool
2020-12-23 17:30:16	JollyRgrs	when you need it... that's the time to read/learn it more

2020-12-23 17:31:34	+s-d	<G​ene> i suppose i should learn more than just ansible for configuration management, heard good things about salt, but chef/puppet seem more popular in job descriptions

2020-12-23 19:16:15	+s-d	<g​ottaname> the thing is, the west has the idea that for you to have a thriving capitalist system, you need democracy

2020-12-23 19:20:12	+s-d	<H​otmess> dosnt appear to have worked in china right now
2020-12-23 19:20:30	+s-d	<g​ottaname> to govern china you need an authoritarian government
2020-12-23 19:20:34	+s-d	<H​otmess> their system is implodeing while russia on the other hand is thriving under a democratic autocasy
2020-12-23 19:20:39	+s-d	<g​ottaname> even if the CCP lost the chinese civil war
2020-12-23 19:21:05	+s-d	<g​ottaname> the kuomingtan KMT would have still ruled china like a dictatorship
2020-12-23 19:21:07	+s-d	<H​otmess> you know given taiwan thats complete bullshit
2020-12-23 19:21:19	+s-d	<g​ottaname> taiwan was only democractic recently

2020-12-23 19:21:21	+s-d	<H​otmess> they are baiscaly the true china and they are a democracy 🙂
2020-12-23 19:21:43	+s-d	<H​otmess> and doing great. the reason tiawan is the true china with democacy is the no1 reason ccp wants to kill it
2020-12-23 19:21:49	+s-d	<g​ottaname> and that was in the late 80s and 90s
2020-12-23 19:21:53	+s-d	<g​ottaname> pretty recent
2020-12-23 19:22:04	+s-d	<H​otmess> and they are loving it
2020-12-23 19:22:12	+s-d	<g​ottaname> also taiwan is a small country
2020-12-23 19:22:12	+s-d	<H​otmess> both economicaly and freedomwise
2020-12-23 19:22:18	+s-d	<g​ottaname> its not a vast country like china
2020-12-23 19:22:28	+s-d	<H​otmess> so china breaks up big deal
2020-12-23 19:22:42	+s-d	<H​otmess> becaomes 10 democratic mini chinas

2020-12-23 19:22:51	+s-d	<g​ottaname> larger country
2020-12-23 19:22:58	+s-d	<H​otmess> also india is the size of china and they only been a democracy for 60 years
2020-12-23 19:23:02	+s-d	<H​otmess> and they are also doing great
2020-12-23 19:23:16	+s-d	<H​otmess> russia is bigger than china. they are a democracy

2020-12-23 21:09:40	teh_f4ll3n	rpifan, Jython is a Python interpreter implementation that compiles Python code to Java
2020-12-23 21:09:40	teh_f4ll3n	bytecode which is then executed by the JVM. Additionally, it is able to import and use
2020-12-23 21:09:40	teh_f4ll3n	any Java class like a Python module.
2020-12-23 21:11:11	rpifan	But it looks like you gotta define classes and shit
2020-12-23 21:12:48	rpifan	Classes are evil
2020-12-23 21:12:58	rpifan	Im a socialist can't have them

2020-12-23 21:41:28	+s-d	<g​ottaname> too bad people misunderstand nuclear radiation
2020-12-23 21:41:53	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, a lot of people don't realize the mess uranium mining created either.
2020-12-23 21:41:56	+s-d	<g​ottaname> I went to go visit japan when the ticket prices were low due to fukushima's scare
2020-12-23 21:42:12	+s-d	<G​ene> we have billions of dollars of clean up to do due to the uranium mining bullshit.
2020-12-23 21:42:12	+s-d	<g​ottaname> seriously, its not that dangerous
2020-12-23 21:42:20	teh_f4ll3n	any 3-headed fish?
2020-12-23 21:42:26	+s-d	<g​ottaname> no
2020-12-23 21:42:38	teh_f4ll3n	shame
2020-12-23 21:42:45	+s-d	<g​ottaname> not like the sea isn't already filled with nuclear reactors
2020-12-23 21:42:46	+s-d	<g​ottaname> 😄
2020-12-23 21:43:02	+s-d	<G​ene> ¯\(ツ)/¯
2020-12-23 21:43:09	+s-d	<g​ottaname> people keep forgetting the US navy isn't powered by fairy dust
2020-12-23 21:43:20	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, most of those are small reactors P:
2020-12-23 21:43:23	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Nuclear fuel is sorta like fairy dust
2020-12-23 21:43:40	+s-d	<g​ottaname> yeah but nuclear missiles onboard nuclear submarines
2020-12-23 21:43:46	teh_f4ll3n	dusty fairies = old gay people
2020-12-23 21:43:56	+s-d	<G​ene> it's not the missiles, it's the power generation.
2020-12-23 21:43:59	+s-d	<g​ottaname> and then run those submarines on windows 2k
2020-12-23 21:43:59	+s-d	<K​orhaka> It's alchemy and just generating heat while sitting there doing nothing. Clearly magic.
2020-12-23 21:44:10	rpifan	What
2020-12-23 21:44:13	+s-d	<G​ene> Reactor sizes range up to ~500 MWt (about 165 MWe) in the larger submarines and surface ships
2020-12-23 21:44:13	+s-d	<G​ene> The largest reactors are still half the size of a standard reactor.
2020-12-23 21:44:21	rpifan	Im a middle aged gay ppl
2020-12-23 21:44:25	teh_f4ll3n	free electricity from magnets
2020-12-23 21:44:28	+s-d	<G​ene> erm, actually, that's 1/5th the size
2020-12-23 21:44:42	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Aircraft carriers don't have to worry about powering Karen's macbook
2020-12-23 21:44:53	+s-d	<g​ottaname> yeah, but imagine if an ICBM detonated right out at sea
2020-12-23 21:45:06	+s-d	<G​ene> we tested thousands of them out at sea?
2020-12-23 21:45:12	+s-d	<g​ottaname> my point
2020-12-23 21:45:15	rpifan	And in spacr
2020-12-23 21:45:17	rpifan	And underground
2020-12-23 21:45:22	rpifan	And on the moon
2020-12-23 21:45:26	+s-d	<g​ottaname> so what's a little radiation leaking from fukushima out to sea?
2020-12-23 21:45:32	+s-d	<G​ene> we also caused a massive spike in cancer; and even got to the point where we have to filter milk for heavy metals.
2020-12-23 21:46:06	+s-d	<g​ottaname> 5G can cause cancer if you're standing right next to the base station
2020-12-23 21:46:07	+s-d	<g​ottaname> 😄
2020-12-23 21:46:31	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Not sure if can, it's non ionising
2020-12-23 21:46:43	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Might cause heating burns though
2020-12-23 21:46:46	+s-d	<g​ottaname> yeah
2020-12-23 21:46:46	+s-d	<G​ene> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131#Effectsofexposure
2020-12-23 21:47:16	+s-d	<g​ottaname> problem is people can't tell the difference between ionizing and non ionizing radiation
2020-12-23 21:47:40	+s-d	<G​ene> solar and wind is the future, smr seem to be too expensive and too late.
2020-12-23 21:47:52	+s-d	<g​ottaname> problem is solar and wind is unstable
2020-12-23 21:47:53	+s-d	<K​orhaka> One makes my lunch boil over and make a mess of the microwave, the other should be pointed at annoying users
2020-12-23 21:47:56	rpifan	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ya_r2zvnDnA
2020-12-23 21:47:57	+s-d	<g​ottaname> and its limited land space
2020-12-23 21:48:07	rpifan	We should use 80s music as a power source
2020-12-23 21:48:20	+s-d	<G​ene> not really, wind and solar are predictable and can easily supply the world's energy several times over.
2020-12-23 21:48:22	rpifan	Powerful snyth vibes can power our civilization for Centuries
2020-12-23 21:48:43	rpifan	Matrix style but with dance contests
2020-12-23 21:48:47	+s-d	<g​ottaname> @Gene even if you coat the world in solar panels and wind turbines?
2020-12-23 21:48:54	+s-d	<G​ene> hundreds of times over.
2020-12-23 21:49:00	+s-d	<g​ottaname> oh rly

2020-12-23 21:49:24	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Now try transporting it
2020-12-23 21:49:35	+s-d	<G​ene> big ass HVDC wires?
2020-12-23 21:49:42	+s-d	<K​orhaka> Also what type of solar is that, would solar thermal be a better choice?
2020-12-23 21:49:46	+s-d	<g​ottaname> it would be super expensive
2020-12-23 21:49:57	+s-d	<g​ottaname> australia is building a high voltage undersea power line
2020-12-23 21:49:59	+s-d	<g​ottaname> to singapore
2020-12-23 21:50:00	+s-d	<g​ottaname> lol

2020-12-23 21:50:08	+s-d	<g​ottaname> but its expensive as fuck
2020-12-23 21:50:16	+s-d	<G​ene> you only need to build the transport lines once tho.
2020-12-23 21:50:31	+s-d	<g​ottaname> they don't need maintanence?
2020-12-23 21:50:40	rpifan	Dance offs
2020-12-23 21:50:54	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, if they get damaged, they'd need to get repaired
2020-12-23 21:51:04	+s-d	<g​ottaname> I still think the future is in tiny, mini reactors
2020-12-23 21:51:21	+s-d	<G​ene> i mean, cities/utilities are pulling out of SMR tech
2020-12-23 21:51:26	+s-d	<G​ene> because it's delayed and runs into issues.

2020-12-23 21:51:54	+s-d	<g​ottaname> asia doesn't care
2020-12-23 21:51:58	+s-d	<g​ottaname> we're still going nuclear
2020-12-23 21:52:06	+s-d	<g​uemi> Uhm.
2020-12-23 21:52:09	+s-d	<G​ene> Did you know, China's deployed 1/3rd of all solar... ever?
2020-12-23 21:52:18	+s-d	<g​uemi> Am I stupid or can 1+1 redunant PSU only have 1 cable input?
2020-12-23 21:52:20	+s-d	<g​ottaname> they're also building new nuclear reactors
2020-12-23 21:52:25	+s-d	<g​ottaname> in fact, all different types of them
2020-12-23 21:52:26	+s-d	<g​uemi> I thought 1+1 meant 2 seperate PSUs, meaning 2 cables?

2020-12-23 21:52:28	+s-d	<g​ottaname> so is india
2020-12-23 21:52:29	+s-d	<G​ene> you got 2 PSU units.
2020-12-23 21:52:32	+s-d	<g​uemi> This is NOT 1+1, right?
2020-12-23 21:52:36	+s-d	<G​ene> no, that's not 1+1
2020-12-23 21:52:40	+s-d	<G​ene> you get 2x of those.
2020-12-23 21:52:42	+s-d	<G​ene> and slide 'em in.
2020-12-23 21:52:46	+s-d	<g​uemi> Right. So I got the wrong one
2020-12-23 21:52:53	+s-d	<g​uemi> I ordered a chassi that only has 1 power plug
2020-12-23 21:52:56	+s-d	<g​uemi> But it says 1+1
2020-12-23 21:52:58	+s-d	<g​uemi> Chieftec
2020-12-23 21:53:01	+s-d	<g​uemi> Must've sent me wrong one
2020-12-23 21:53:06	+s-d	<G​ene> erm? there could be a low-profile PSU that fits
2020-12-23 21:53:12	teh_f4ll3n	Right, I need to do some shopping before they lock everything down for XMAS

2020-12-23 21:53:30	+s-d	<G​ene> ffs.
2020-12-23 21:53:30	+s-d	<g​ottaname> @Gene since the power blackout from the coal thing, likely they're going to accelerate their energy programs further
2020-12-23 21:53:43	+s-d	<g​ottaname> well, ATMs don't need high avaliability
2020-12-23 21:53:46	+s-d	<g​ottaname> if its down, its down
2020-12-23 21:53:46	+s-d	<G​ene> China's currently #1 solar manufacturer in the world.
2020-12-23 21:53:48	+s-d	<g​ottaname> use another ATM

2020-12-23 21:54:10	+s-d	<g​uemi> Yet I got the one on the picture.
2020-12-23 21:54:13	+s-d	<g​uemi> So yeah, they fucked up then.

2020-12-23 21:54:40	+s-d	<g​ottaname> @Gene they've also deployed most of the new nuclear power plants as well
2020-12-23 21:54:49	+s-d	<g​ottaname> so going for solar isn't they're only plan
2020-12-23 21:54:56	+s-d	<G​ene> US has something like 90-or-so nuclear plants
2020-12-23 21:55:05	+s-d	<G​ene> each plant has 1-4 reactors onsite

2020-12-23 21:56:14	+s-d	<g​ottaname> but they're doing nuclear as well
2020-12-23 21:56:20	+s-d	<g​ottaname> got to remember, china does alot of coal
2020-12-23 21:56:26	+s-d	<g​ottaname> they got to replace all of that
2020-12-23 21:56:31	+s-d	<G​ene> i think they're still building new coal too.
2020-12-23 21:56:36	teh_f4ll3n	Construct additional pylons!
2020-12-23 21:57:16	+s-d	<g​ottaname> @Gene also the UAE just powered on their new nuclear power plant this year

2020-12-23 21:57:28	+s-d	<G​ene> I mean, we're talking about what? 20-50 plants?
2020-12-23 21:57:40	+s-d	<G​ene> in the next decade.
2020-12-23 21:58:03	+s-d	<g​ottaname> consider this, most of the world's population is in india and china

2020-12-24 06:25:13	+s-d	<y​assssssssssssss> Honestly, I'm just using a company repository which shared courses for employees. so in fact I don't pay anything and instead of free documentation I'm using free courses.
2020-12-24 06:25:39	+s-d	<n​eppy> can someone explain to me the travel path of an email? or point me to a technical doc that describes it. For instance, I want to know if I send an email to test@domain1.com, whats the resolution path. does my smtp resolve the IP, and then send the mail to ip, then the mail serever at ip processes the mail by the domain portion?
2020-12-24 06:26:06	+s-d	<n​eppy> and when my smtp server resolves the IP of domain1.com, does it resolve it using a PTR record or does it use the MX record?

2020-12-24 06:27:53	+AnonymooseReddtr	MX stands for mail transfer
2020-12-24 06:29:29	+s-d	<n​eppy> so smtp does an MX lookup on domain1.com, it doesn't do an MX lookup on the resolved IP? Actually i guess thats easy enough for me to look at aon my own...lol
2020-12-24 06:30:02	+s-d	<D​enominator00> thats not how dns works
2020-12-24 06:30:33	+s-d	<n​eppy> yeah I realize that., dumb question.
2020-12-24 06:31:22	+s-d	<D​enominator00> also your SMTP server probably uses a smarthost, so the smarthost would be doing a DNS lookup for the MX record and then sending to that address
2020-12-24 06:33:22	+s-d	<n​eppy> Ok, any way for me to just create an email server that takes any mail sent to whatever@domain1.com, and forward it to whatever@domain2.com, but change the actual domain alias. I have an offsite mail server for domain2.com, and I want all email sent to domain1.com to forward to domain2.com, but I need the domain alias to change as well. so ben@domain1.com becomes ben@domain2.com
2020-12-24 06:33:56	+s-d	<n​eppy> better question, what terms should I google to get my answer

2020-12-26 17:21:55	+s-d	<f​irebarber> 911 service is down all over the place
2020-12-26 17:22:25	+s-d	<f​irebarber> Really strange though that nothing went down for nearly six hours after the bomb went off.
2020-12-26 17:23:13	+s-d	<f​irebarber> I’m guessing water damage from broken pipes or they ran out of diesel
2020-12-26 17:24:06	+s-d	<f​irebarber> ATT rep said that service is down for “some customers in Nashville and the surrounding areas” - couldn’t possibly be more vague
2020-12-26 17:24:21	+s-d	<f​irebarber> No idea when it will be restored
2020-12-26 17:25:38	Hunterkll	No diesel
2020-12-26 17:25:42	Hunterkll	for 6 hours they were on pure battery power
2020-12-26 17:25:48	Hunterkll	equipment started thermal failing
2020-12-26 17:25:54	+s-d	<f​irebarber> That’s nuts
2020-12-26 17:25:56	Hunterkll	and the backup generators are natural gas, which was cut to the affected area

2020-12-26 17:32:19	Hunterkll	supposedly they're boring holes in the back of the building to feed generator cables in b/c they can't do it safely from the front
2020-12-26 17:32:43	+s-d	<f​irebarber> Wife woke me up this morning and tells me there’s an explosion. Here I was thinking I was lucky that everything was still working
2020-12-26 17:32:45	Hunterkll	the 2 1MW generators listed in that update are apparently ones that TEMA is offering up, but they can get their own onsite faster apparently
2020-12-26 17:33:02	Hunterkll	TEMA being your state-level equivalent of FEMA
2020-12-26 17:33:26	+s-d	<f​irebarber> Then about noon I get like 50 alerts
2020-12-26 17:34:19	Hunterkll	but yea - there is *some* redundancy in a lot of older techs, redundant circuits, etc
2020-12-26 17:34:45	Hunterkll	apparently the failover site didn't pick up the slack enough, and other physical damage was interfering with things - like any dedicated circuits to that CO are just done
2020-12-26 17:35:00	Hunterkll	and SONET stuff is on it's way out, but would have handled this gracefully, in comparison
2020-12-26 17:35:08	Hunterkll	but
2020-12-26 17:35:17	Hunterkll	you have to think about this not from a logical/network redundancy perspective
2020-12-26 17:35:22	Hunterkll	but from a physical layout of the wires/lines perspective
2020-12-26 17:35:37	Hunterkll	there's only so many physical routes in cities
2020-12-26 17:37:55	Hunterkll	That CO connects to Memphis, Farmington, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Louisville, and Jackson mississippi 
2020-12-26 17:38:24	Hunterkll	and provides branch out service toa ll the sub COs providing phone etc to local areas
2020-12-26 17:39:46	Hunterkll	COs originally started out as switching hubs for just the regular copper phone network, of course, it only makes sense that you already have all the construction, etc done to run the phone wires, just ride on top instead of totally tearing the entire place up....
2020-12-26 17:43:39	Hunterkll	Basically, this point is the /physical/ part of the infrastructure ... much harder to do full redundancy there.... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange

2020-12-30 22:23:26	DeepSpaceK9	Put traffic shaper on PC. Bandwidth drop. Unplug ethernet from that PC. Bandwidth tanks down into Kbps used.
2020-12-30 22:23:36	CptLuxx	what? you had the ip
2020-12-30 22:23:43	CptLuxx	then you get the hostname.. then you know the pc
2020-12-30 22:23:46	DeepSpaceK9	No, I had an IP >range<
2020-12-30 22:23:56	CptLuxx	the fortinet shows the source ip normaly..
2020-12-30 22:24:05	DeepSpaceK9	Fortinet is useless without telemetry
2020-12-30 22:24:12	CptLuxx	eh no
2020-12-30 22:24:18	DeepSpaceK9	Yes because it only shows LAN traffic, not WAN
2020-12-30 22:24:24	DeepSpaceK9	Yay licensing
2020-12-30 22:24:27	CptLuxx	then you have something wrong configured
2020-12-30 22:24:31	DeepSpaceK9	Nope
2020-12-30 22:24:36	DeepSpaceK9	It says right on the page that telemetry is required
2020-12-30 22:24:37	CptLuxx	even my one fortinet that has no license shows that
2020-12-30 22:24:48	DeepSpaceK9	Dunno what to tell you then
2020-12-30 22:24:59	xe0n	loll
2020-12-30 22:25:00	DeepSpaceK9	Our license is basically updates only
2020-12-30 22:25:07	DeepSpaceK9	and basic support
2020-12-30 22:25:14	CptLuxx	 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-12-30 22:25:21	CptLuxx	i say your fortinet is wrong configured
2020-12-30 22:25:34	DeepSpaceK9	Well Fortinet themselves don't seem to think so, I had them remoted into it
2020-12-30 22:25:43	DeepSpaceK9	So IDFK
2020-12-30 22:25:57	DeepSpaceK9	All I know is I seemed to have found my bandwidth hog by narrowing down a traffic shaper until I was left with one IP being squirrely
2020-12-30 22:26:08	+s-d	<W​emmer> @ estranger, It's a very small shop, with not a lot of users and or clients depending on the PKI. I would ideally like to see at least a two tier PKI with an offline CA, but like you say, that's for another day. Had I had more time to deal with it atm, I would have gone the route of setting that up. 
2020-12-30 22:26:08	+s-d	<W​emmer> 
2020-12-30 22:26:08	+s-d	<W​emmer> My question mainly comes from the fact that certificate #0 keeps reappearing whenever the CertSvc is restarted on the server, and that when we do monitoring for certificates on Windows Servers, we tend to monitor installed in the Personal store and that then triggers an event due to the already expired cert being there. Hence I'm wondering whether this is intended behaviour from AD CS, or if something can be configured somewhere.
2020-12-30 22:26:23	DeepSpaceK9	From there I was able to look at what IP matched what Host in Fortinet, and that's when I targeted that box.
2020-12-30 22:27:18	DeepSpaceK9	Side note, in one of the Fortinet instruction pages, there's apparently a Firewall drop down. Now while I have firewall options, I do not have a firewall drop down on the main menu. Which I thought was odd.
2020-12-30 22:27:33	CptLuxx	screenshot...
2020-12-30 22:27:37	CptLuxx	what firmware version?
2020-12-30 22:27:55	DeepSpaceK9	Sec so I can grab both versions of 'truth'
2020-12-30 22:28:01	DeepSpaceK9	6.0.10

2020-12-30 22:28:18	CptLuxx	is that even patched against the ssl von exploit?
2020-12-30 22:28:32	xe0n	i would look at getting support so you can update the firmware at least
2020-12-30 22:28:38	xe0n	that's the first purchase you need to convince them on
2020-12-30 22:28:56	DeepSpaceK9	I can update the firmware
2020-12-30 22:28:56	CptLuxx	ah was patched in 6.0.4
2020-12-30 22:29:06	+s-d	<H​asher> I think the directory traversal exploit was up to 6.0.5
2020-12-30 22:29:20	xe0n	i'd update the firmware
2020-12-30 22:29:22	xe0n	lol
2020-12-30 22:29:25	DeepSpaceK9	That menu option being missing is probably related to the firmware being older

2020-12-30 22:40:02	+s-d	<c​orona266> yea, it's the only way to cure type 1 diabetes
2020-12-30 22:40:24	DeepSpaceK9	US citizens actually travel out of the USA to get pancreas transplants because I guess you either can't get them here or there's a whole lot of red tape.
2020-12-30 22:40:38	+s-d	<c​orona266> they tried healthy cell transplant which worked in a small case of individuals, but not enough to make it viable
2020-12-30 22:40:39	+s-d	<c​orona266> also
2020-12-30 22:40:46	+s-d	<K​hroners> Hey, i will have this afternoon my first homeserver ! HP DL360P G8. I'm very happy! Will try to install ESXI 6.7 on it to learn ESXI environment
2020-12-30 22:41:14	+s-d	<c​orona266> getting a pancreas and kidney transplant simultaneously had a shorter wait list than just a kidney or pancreas alone
2020-12-30 22:41:15	+s-d	<K​hroners> I'm a total newbie with server, never touched one yet
2020-12-30 22:41:20	+s-d	<H​asher> thats exciting @corona266 , thats absolutely life changing for him
2020-12-30 22:41:27	DeepSpaceK9	I have both type 1 and type 2 (low production AND resistance), I wont the worst lottery. I'd love to have a transplant to fix half my problem.
2020-12-30 22:41:34	DeepSpaceK9	I won*
2020-12-30 22:42:00	+s-d	<c​orona266> it definitely is, he's diabetes free for the first time in 40-something years
2020-12-30 22:42:17	+s-d	<R​ootbear75> How does this make any sense?
2020-12-30 22:42:50	DeepSpaceK9	Khroners: Enjoy! For homelabbing, ESXi is definitely really simple to use. It only becomes a difficult child when you need to go fetch and inject drivers for unsupported hardware haha
2020-12-30 22:42:51	+s-d	<c​orona266> i'm really not sure, but not looking a gift horse in the mouth
2020-12-30 22:43:33	DeepSpaceK9	So
2020-12-30 22:43:44	DeepSpaceK9	If your diabetic issue is a lack of production of insulin from the pancreas

2020-12-31 09:23:30	SleePy	Technology was against me today.  Remote location goes down in the middle of maintenance on server, my outlook freezes up, two users send in helpdesk tickets at the same time with their systems not working and the hypervisor host for the monitoring server locks up.
2020-12-31 09:23:55	SleePy	And my helpdesk guy was on vacation and my other admin working on other things..  So yea...

2020-12-31 09:29:47	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> which microsoft got shit on so badly for that vista was universal
2020-12-31 09:30:00	SleePy	Especially when you worked in a repair shop.  Reinstalling XP was sometimes a guess as to which install CD you used
2020-12-31 09:30:10	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> dude
2020-12-31 09:30:15	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I'd rather play russian roulette

2020-12-31 09:30:38	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> theres 100+ different possible CDs you need
2020-12-31 09:30:44	SleePy	XP, XP SP1, XP SP2, XP OEM, XP Dell, XP HP, XP (etc)..
2020-12-31 09:30:52	+s-d	<H​asher> Xp source is available by less than legal means. You theoretically could compile your own
2020-12-31 09:30:58	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> and that's just from the OEM markers
2020-12-31 09:31:17	SleePy	Don't forget the media center edition

2020-12-31 09:31:54	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> don't think so
2020-12-31 09:32:12	+s-d	<H​asher> n was a thing in so
2020-12-31 09:32:15	SleePy	I think that was Vista because of the euro lawsuit
2020-12-31 09:32:15	+s-d	<H​asher> So
2020-12-31 09:32:23	+s-d	<H​asher> Ugh... xp

2020-12-31 09:33:03	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> well I'd never heard of N before win10 so

2020-12-31 09:33:21	+s-d	<H​asher> Legals....
2020-12-31 09:33:36	SleePy	Win 7 had N I know.  I just don't recall if Vista or XP did.
2020-12-31 09:34:25	SleePy	The best thing was when you got a Win 7 Ultimate CD.  Repair shop loved that.  It would install any edition of Win 7..
2020-12-31 09:34:33	+s-d	<H​asher> I think it started with ME. That the forced multimedia associations were untenable
2020-12-31 09:35:38	+s-d	<H​asher> It’s also 7pm and I might be beyond what sober me remembers
2020-12-31 09:36:16	SleePy	I'm just glad I didn't really have to work with anything prior to XP in my career, besides Windows 3.1 once..  My old coworker called 98, Plug-in-Pray
2020-12-31 09:37:21	+s-d	<H​asher> Plug and play was great. No more wrestling Irq interrupts
2020-12-31 09:37:32	+s-d	<H​asher> Ugh
2020-12-31 09:37:45	SleePy	Except for when you plugged in a USB device and it blue screened
2020-12-31 09:38:25	+s-d	<H​asher> Well. I guess. But that was pretty short lived
2020-12-31 09:38:47	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> wat
2020-12-31 09:38:57	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> I've been doing this longer than you have SleePy?
2020-12-31 09:39:56	SleePy	I got to say..  The Windows 3.1 system I worked on.  That was great.  Old lady brought it in, it had all of her farming data on it and wouldn't boot.  We pop it open and I'm thinking blown caps.  There was no caps to be found on the board.  Clean it up, boot it up, battery is dead.

2020-12-31 10:04:26	SleePy	Displays on our production line.  Custom software I built.  The RPI actually just boots up a minimal X, launches chromium, sends some info about the device in a URL, which tells the app server what to display on that screen

2020-12-31 10:09:21	jimender2	SleePy what platform did you code the stuff in for the RPIs?
2020-12-31 10:09:35	SleePy	jimender2: The web server?
2020-12-31 10:09:37	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> no that stimulus check is already in my savings
2020-12-31 10:09:39	jimender2	yes
2020-12-31 10:10:14	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> and imho the 'stimulus check's are fucking retarded
2020-12-31 10:10:27	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> if the government actually cared they'd have nationalized healthcare instead
2020-12-31 10:10:34	SleePy	Its IIS using PHP with a SQL server backend.  I know PHP way better than ASP.NET or .NET Core.  The web page itself is built using minimal HTML, then uses javascript to issue json requests to the backend and update data on the screens.  
2020-12-31 10:11:14	jimender2	If you have a chance to check it out, try using Ignition by inductive automation.  It is really really powerful and well worth the price
2020-12-31 10:11:22	SleePy	SQL Server is the real winner here.  We have it linked to our ERP and various other sql servers on our production line.  I pull all that data into the app
2020-12-31 10:12:16	jimender2	What ERP?  Ive been doing a lot of programming with one of the major ones
2020-12-31 10:12:41	SleePy	IBM iSeries AS/400.

2020-12-31 11:29:11	misspwn	we use the keurig since we have maybe 2 cups a day and i keep trying to find a new coffee and he's insistant that all of them are terrible

2020-12-31 11:30:53	+s-d	<S​teelANDGusto> I'd like to move from defense to commercial it. The challenge I'm facing is there are few commercial companies in my area that will pay me as well as defense currently. I'm leaning more and more towards taking a pay cut in order to do work I'm passionate about. I really only have a year of experience so I don't have ground to stand on to be choossie.
2020-12-31 11:31:02	+enix	Noone cares

2020-12-31 11:53:02	xe0n	hey dude
2020-12-31 11:53:08	nojeffrey	Hello
2020-12-31 11:53:13	xe0n	what's your end goal you're trying to acheive?
2020-12-31 11:53:41	+enix	he's trying to control algos with TCP congestion
2020-12-31 11:53:42	+enix	Dur
2020-12-31 11:54:24	nojeffrey	Well, lets say 50 VM's on a hypervisor, connected to a SAN, these 50 VMs all share a single tcp session
2020-12-31 11:54:43	nojeffrey	long response times when there are retranmissions 
2020-12-31 11:54:44	+enix	do they?
2020-12-31 11:55:03	+enix	I thought it'd um... masquerade?
2020-12-31 11:55:05	+enix	is that the word?
2020-12-31 11:55:08	nojeffrey	From my pcaps > zeek logs I thought they did
2020-12-31 11:56:13	xe0n	so you're trying to gain performance?
2020-12-31 11:56:52	nojeffrey	Anyway we pushed out BBR(Google wrote it in 2016) and seems to have noticably better response times, but there are like ~16 of these congestion algo's, and thought one may be better suited to iscsi traffic
2020-12-31 11:57:46	nojeffrey	Yeah from ~50ms HTTP response times on applications, to seconds - trying to eliminate that
2020-12-31 11:58:01	csws	"I'm in"
2020-12-31 11:58:03	+enix	are you sure it's iops?
2020-12-31 11:58:49	nojeffrey	Everything points to tcp being the bottleneck
2020-12-31 11:59:03	+enix	so you iostat on hte machine and see iowait creep
2020-12-31 11:59:09	+enix	on the vm
2020-12-31 11:59:11	nojeffrey	20gbit connections, at most 4-5gbit
2020-12-31 11:59:26	xe0n	so take a step back - you've only got one path from your storage to the hosts?

2021-01-12 23:09:57	+s-d	<H​unterkll> in terms of the update system - not the upgrades of components themselves
2021-01-12 23:09:58	fritzwastaken	:-( thats sad
2021-01-12 23:10:15	+s-d	<H​unterkll> i should install 1507 for the hell of it and see what happens
2021-01-12 23:10:16	+s-d	<H​unterkll> lol

2021-01-12 23:10:24	+s-d	<H​unterkll> well, hell, a fresh install would probably work just fine
2021-01-12 23:10:24	+s-d	<j​imender2> I had one instance where I had to run an old version of it and then a newer version but that was one demented computer
2021-01-12 23:10:29	grumplestiltzkin	sometimes days not in the office are the most productive  -  But I do work that isn't just my main gig
2021-01-12 23:11:13	xe0n	burnout much?
2021-01-12 23:12:40	grumplestiltzkin	xe0n, it was a real fight a few years ago against burnout. and I still ride close to the edge, bt I figured out - more potential for burnout means I'm not doing exactly the right thing as my main gig
2021-01-12 23:13:02	grumplestiltzkin	so I'm in a different position now, things are much better, and working on the next step
2021-01-12 23:13:23	grumplestiltzkin	getting results on 'passion proijects' that might be able to be monetized helps too
2021-01-12 23:13:34	grumplestiltzkin	monetized/similar
2021-01-12 23:14:47	grumplestiltzkin	honestly, quitting drinking helped too, as funny as that sounds
2021-01-12 23:15:10	estranger	doesn't sound funny at all imo
2021-01-12 23:15:21	supaman	almost logical even
2021-01-12 23:15:35	estranger	if drinking is to remind stress, it's prob just making your stress worse
2021-01-12 23:15:44	estranger	s/remind/remove
2021-01-12 23:15:44	l8	estranger meant: "if drinking is to remove stress, it's prob just making your stress worse"
2021-01-12 23:16:22	estranger	especially daily drinking
2021-01-12 23:17:35	+s-d	<j​imender2> who ever decided that the outlook notification should override over one of the corner little icons deserves to be shot
2021-01-12 23:18:24	xe0n	isnt it just a toast notification?
2021-01-12 23:18:46	xe0n	i dunno, i just get the mail icon in my system tray?
2021-01-12 23:19:02	xe0n	and tom hanks.mp3 playing "you've got mail!"
2021-01-12 23:19:33	Jaelae	i had an older desktop core i7 4770. nvidia 1080 card. I have a new machine so i didnt need it but i scavenged a few parts. i ended up piecing it together cause my neighbors computer broke and i brought it over
2021-01-12 23:19:34	+s-d	<j​imender2> you dont get the thing saying the subject/some of the body of it?
2021-01-12 23:19:38	Jaelae	they were like oh no thanks he wants a laptop
2021-01-12 23:19:46	Jaelae	it was for gaming in his room
2021-01-12 23:19:48	 *	Jaelae shrugs.

2021-01-12 23:21:16	Jaelae	ah well

2021-01-12 23:21:43	Jaelae	oh yea
2021-01-12 23:21:50	Jaelae	i got kids and they got kids so we talk
2021-01-12 23:22:00	Jaelae	i even talk to those without kids thoug hthey often dont go out of their way to talk to me
2021-01-12 23:22:03	Jaelae	but i don't care
2021-01-12 23:22:07	DrZak	children discussions

2021-01-12 23:23:29	DrZak	depilation
2021-01-12 23:23:35	fritzwastaken	mmmmmm good ole scrambled eggs and toast
2021-01-12 23:23:40	JollyRgrs	DrZak: funny, it looked like a conversation about neighbors and the reason why he talked to his neighbor is b/c they both have kids (who I presume play with each other)
2021-01-12 23:23:40	fritzwastaken	nommy nom nomz
2021-01-12 23:23:52	DrZak	hehe
