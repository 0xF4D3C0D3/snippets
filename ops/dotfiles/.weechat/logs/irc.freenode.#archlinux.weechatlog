2020-12-19 07:45:56	GodGinrai	So, I'm a bit lost on this gpg keyring stuff for AUR.  I'm trying to make and install palemoon using the PKGBUILD from the AUR and I am getting an error telling me that I don't have a necessary key.  I am trying to use `gpg --recv-key <key>` to import the key, however I get an error with "keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure".  I've tried adding a file called `~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf` 
2020-12-19 07:46:02	GodGinrai	with a keyserver line to define a keyserver, however that doesn't seem to have done anything about the error.  Am I on the complete wrong track here?

2020-12-19 12:33:03	rcf	gonification: particularly with the state of the base metapackage (a 'standard' Arch install now targets containers, for the most part) I imagine that -- if alarm did not already exist to divert Arch users wanting something similar on ARM -- generic aarch64 and armv7h support might well exist in Arch proper.

2020-12-20 05:27:12	gregdan3	this is dhcpcd's take. same issue results.
2020-12-20 05:27:39	NetSysFire	does your router log your mac? are you sure the error messages are caused by your device?
2020-12-20 05:27:47	gregdan3	well, it doesn't cycle attempts over and over. but that's it
2020-12-20 05:28:11	gregdan3	NetSysFire: the modem doesn't log that, it looks like. those errors were simply there; i can't determine cause from the info I have.

2020-12-20 05:31:08	gregdan3	lol. tbh i'm not so worried about this error, since I have a router i can and do use, but there's a different problem with it. i have openwrt on a WRT3200ACM, and everything works; i get an IPv4 and IPv6 leased from upstream and can use the internet. but I cannot interact with any IPv4 host. and I don't know why.

2020-12-21 01:36:30	Sarcutus	Namarrgon: Would you recommend a particular utility, like dd or Clonezilla or something else?
2020-12-21 01:36:50	Namarrgon	"cp -a" will do fine

2020-12-21 01:37:07	Namarrgon	you can't really use dd for this as it would copy the whole fs
2020-12-21 01:37:08	grawity	those work at partition level, so restoring a dd backup would just restore the ext4 along with it

2020-12-21 01:39:46	grawity	well, you *can* use dd for making a backup image (e.g. if you do not have a suitable backup disk, then you can put an ext4 image onto an NTFS or exFAT disk) – but you'll still need to use file-level tools (cp -a) to restore out of it
2020-12-21 01:40:20	Sarcutus	Namarrgon: will rsync work for this, or is cp -a the best tool?

2020-12-21 01:44:45	Namarrgon	you will also need to exclude a lot of paths if you're booted in that system

2020-12-21 01:45:47	kerframil	Sarcutus: I would highly recommend the addition of --numeric-ids to the options that have been mentioend. user mapping can do you no good in this instance.

2020-12-21 01:46:20	grawity	hmm yeah --numeric-ids is probably a good idea, saw quite a few people mess up UIDs and GIDs that way

2020-12-21 03:57:22	aminvakil	you basically tell dnsmasq what are your custom domains are and which ip they should resolve to, then you tell it what is its upstream dns server and it will resolve the rest of them from it
2020-12-21 03:57:27	aminvakil	from the upstream
2020-12-21 03:58:27	aminvakil	then you put your clients to use dnsmasq as their dns server, probably by setting your machine ip on your access point dhcp server on dns server section

2020-12-21 05:50:34	d3m0nm4dn3ss	I think that the main issue with systemd is it's design, quite a few packages (gamemode for example) depend on systemd for it's functionality and there are no ports for other inits, if systemd just broke up it's modules into different packages then it wouldn't be a problem

2020-12-21 05:54:14	cipherize	ejsav: The point is that you can't point at your system right now and explain the function of every individual file. Reminiscing about a C64 is an intellectually dishonest non sequitor.
2020-12-21 05:54:20	ejsav	to say that nobody can understand their computer to a large degree is a very lazy argument

2020-12-21 06:19:55	ville	howdy. making a keymap for x and i'm remapping prtsc to alt and that works out fine, but when i try to paste in terminal with alt+ctrl+v the order in which i press the mapped prtsc/alt and ctrl matters whether the pasting action triggers. how do i fix this so the order doesn't matter
2020-12-21 06:20:56	ville	if i press down ctrl, then the mapped prtsc/alt, and lastly v it won't paste. but if i reverse the order of the modifier keys it works

2020-12-22 05:57:50	Naruni	Hello, I'm having quite a strange issue here. I have a file containing lines that are " 32123", a whitespace followed by 32 then three random numbers.  I'm trying to strip the whitespace and replace with 032.  I'm using sed -e 's/(32)/032/g' but the output shows the same exact lines as read from the file

2020-12-22 10:30:26	sgibber2018	If he doesn't know which boot loader you're using he can't give you good advice. I would first do something like google how to check your boot loader, and then look up the arch wiki page for that boot loader, and then look at the kernel parameters page. I don't know the answer to your question but that's the best route to take. Good luck :)

2020-12-23 00:52:44	dak	you need to install arch to a diffrent partition inside the vps
2020-12-23 00:52:45	mulotizef	I hope a day I turn to Arch
2020-12-23 00:52:52	dak	then boot that partition then delete the default arch install
2020-12-23 00:52:57	dak	google...
2020-12-23 00:53:09	mulotizef	yes Manji is not Arch for sure
2020-12-23 00:53:18	NetSysFire	spin up a vm with the archiso and attempt a basic installation
2020-12-23 00:53:19	dak	manjaro is trash
2020-12-23 00:53:38	dak	you cant inside a ovh vps
2020-12-23 00:53:40	NetSysFire	there are plenty of reasons why you shouldnt use manjaro

2020-12-23 00:54:13	dak	i have seen people do this with linux and installed openbsd 
2020-12-23 00:54:19	mulotizef	I did a live-usb pendrive of this korrupt.iso so now I reboot and see whats going on

2020-12-23 00:55:45	tatsumaru	guys I have this issue with xfce4 on a fresh install where it shows Filesystemroot and boot on your desktop for a non-root user and I don't remember what was causing this
2020-12-23 00:56:03	tonitch	wait, is installing dhcpcd can change something ?
2020-12-23 00:56:37	sheep	installing dhcpcd won't change anything, but enabling it to run at boot would make it do DHCP configuration
2020-12-23 00:56:52	ayekat	tatsumaru: missing home directory, perhaps?

2020-12-23 00:57:25	ayekat	sheep: according to their previous output, they already had systemd-networkd acquire an IP address via DHCP, though - so it might rather cause conflicts there, no?
2020-12-23 00:57:31	sheep	oh right it would
2020-12-23 00:57:32	gabbiel	cipherize: its what im used to, ill change to networkmanager in the future, but netctl does the job for me
2020-12-23 00:57:32	tatsumaru	I remember I had this issue a long time ago but can't remember what the solution was
2020-12-23 00:57:34	mulotizef	half-downloaded
2020-12-23 00:57:58	tonitch	I mean, what if I uninstall all file I don't understand then install NetworkManager... maybe this could work
2020-12-23 00:58:06	cipherize	gabbiel: might change now given that networkmanager has a wireguard plugin.
2020-12-23 00:58:23	ayekat	tonitch: you may also need to (un)configure systemd-networkd if you plan to install any other network management tool

2020-12-23 21:23:23	Namarrgon	why did you install two loaders?
2020-12-23 21:23:30	Foxboron	this is entierly broken
2020-12-23 21:23:34	gildasio29	Foxboron: no, it's just the commands I used
2020-12-23 21:24:04	ayekat	so you've set up both grub and systemd-boot?
2020-12-23 21:24:10	Namarrgon	you can't use systemd-boot in this case anyway since your kernel is encrypted
2020-12-23 21:24:12	gildasio29	I was trying only with grub. The second systemd- was just trying to figure something out
2020-12-23 21:24:28	Foxboron	Why are you encrypting boot?
2020-12-23 21:25:05	gildasio29	in my current configuration (in a hdd) I have everything (except /boot/efi) encrypted, so want to do the same
2020-12-23 21:25:44	Foxboron	right, but only grub handles encrypted boot. That is also why you specify luks1 as the encryption version
2020-12-23 21:25:56	gildasio29	I follow the same steps I did months ago when installing in the almost same hardware (only one change: hdd -> ssd)
2020-12-23 21:26:33	gildasio29	 yeah Foxboron but it doesn't work too :/
2020-12-23 21:26:33	Foxboron	The issue is you have using two boot loaders and systemd can't decrypt anything. So what was the issue with grub?
2020-12-23 21:27:03	gildasio29	When I was installing without systemd-boot only with grub, my system doesn't boot anyway

2020-12-23 21:27:43	Foxboron	Reboot with archiso, mount everything. Remove the systemd boot entry with efibootmgr and remove all the systemd boot stuff.

2020-12-24 19:17:25	jeromelanteri	Xanomead, i have 970Evo SSD 1To and PNY CS3030 1Tb. the quicker (970) is for system and /home dir and virtual boxes, the other is to store data. They are working very good together.

2020-12-24 19:19:56	jeromelanteri	rikta, you should boot on a USB bootable device (maybe you would have to go through the BIOS systel to set this to be possible) then debug from console.
2020-12-24 19:20:51	jeromelanteri	there is also some live system to boot from USB (some of them dedicated for repair system).
2020-12-24 19:21:40	jeromelanteri	next you would like to mount your root directory to check log files to understand why kernel panic.
2020-12-24 19:21:52	rikta	any idea which logifle to look at?

2020-12-24 19:23:32	jeromelanteri	rikta, you maybe have anb idea about "why it does break", and from there you should have an idea which log file to checkj (if need to check any). You would also like to check that any root directory is not full.

2020-12-25 07:45:55	grawity	but just in case, re-do the bootloader config
2020-12-25 07:46:24	grawity	on the other hand, if you're using systemd-boot or something else, you have to specify the initrd= while writing the loader config

2020-12-26 17:36:40	guruprasad	post-factum, atm I have ter-124n as the font defined there
2020-12-26 17:37:28	guruprasad	But I did switch to other fonts for a larger text size and while that worked for all the other console text, this encryption prompt from GRUB stage 1 (even before it is fully loaded) still remains too small
2020-12-26 17:40:27	seankhliao	doesn't grub have its own settings and a grub-mkfont thingy

2020-12-26 17:42:04	guruprasad	seankhliao, GRUB itself shows text in proper size afaics. It is just the initial decryption prompt that is too small
2020-12-26 17:42:06	Betal	bentinata: I was thinking in a different idea, but iam not 100% sure if this would work. About creating a virtual screen with Xvfb, and connecting two times with x11vnc using the -clip option, then you would place them where you want
2020-12-26 17:43:26	bentinata	I'm going to give it a try. Thanks Betal.

My understanding is that efi appears under /boot.  I would then mount my root disk under /mnt, create /mnt/boot and mount the boot partition there, and create /mnt/boot/efi and mount the efi partition there.

(so if you had it set up and your kernel was signed if someone messed with it the UEFI firmware wouldn't allow it to run because the tampering messes up the sig, giving you a heads up)

2020-12-30 21:00:57	Diagon	Right, but the stuff in /boot/efi.  Those files aren't part of the distro, are they?  Or...
2020-12-30 21:00:59	Foxboron	that's pretty much all there is to it
2020-12-30 21:01:19	Foxboron	Diagon: those files are managed by your bootloader

2020-12-30 21:04:53	muddyarch	but the UEFI checks for *.efi programs and executes them, which is what your bootloader would be

2020-12-31 07:50:21	daishun	I have this weird issue after temporarily installing and starting NetworkManager.service to test a wifi adapter. I have since disabled networkmanager and gone back to using systemd-networkd with a wired connection. The issue is that I use a program called exercism to download and submit programming exercises using an API. Now the api will only work if I enable networkmanager so that it connects via wifi otherwise the API returns a 
2020-12-31 07:50:21	daishun	connection error: "Get https://api.exercism.io/v1/ping: dial tcp: lookup api.exercism.io on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:42325->[::1]:53: read: connection refused". This is a really obsure problem but does anyone have an idea what might be causing the api request to fail now?

2020-12-31 10:09:04	NetSysFire	!doesntwork
2020-12-31 10:09:05	@phrik	What do you mean it doesn't work? If there's an error, *tell us*. If it's more than two lines, see !paste.

2021-01-12 23:11:43	jungdongho	hello! I'm trying to mount ESP to /efi while referring to [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition#Mount_the_partition)

2021-01-12 23:12:05	bf_	Hey guys, I have some stupid questions again about segmentation of different services on the same machine :) 
2021-01-12 23:12:47	bf_	Currently, each service is built via docker-compose and is run under individual users. e.g. /home/service-a and /home/service-b
2021-01-12 23:12:59	jungdongho	so I did mkdir /efi and mount /dev/sda1 /efi and it said "mount: /efi: wrong fs type, bad option..."
2021-01-12 23:13:10	bf_	What is the best way to ensure that service-a does not know about service-b?
2021-01-12 23:13:22	bf_	I do not want to rely on docker's security but do it the proper arch way
2021-01-12 23:14:11	qin	containerization isnt a bad option, depends on how hidden u really want it to be.
2021-01-12 23:14:18	foxide	Pretty sure the proper arch way is to do it via docker, which its docker's job.
2021-01-12 23:14:19	qin	the arch way, is to keep stuff simple? :P
2021-01-12 23:14:41	bf_	so you would say having different users for each service & docker would be OK?
2021-01-12 23:16:18	bf_	Is there something else I could wrap docker in which would give one more onion layer & more logs? 
2021-01-12 23:17:49	bf_	(e.g. there is firejail but it seems to be focused on single applications and not work so well with docker)

2021-01-12 23:18:59	bf_	Or maybe there is a way to run multiple docker daemons (one per user/service) and thereby be less dependent on docker's isolation guarantees?

2021-01-12 23:22:07	qin	does anyone have apt-cacher-ng working with arch properly?
2021-01-12 23:22:53	MrChainman	I have an encrpypted home drive (followed the aw article) and have issues getting user systemd units to start. It just looks like systemd does'nt even try to start them, altough they are enabled. Starting them manually works fine. Anyone got an idea what I have to do to make it work?
2021-01-12 23:24:02	CubeTheThird	what are you doing to try and have them start automatically?
2021-01-12 23:24:14	CubeTheThird	what's the trigger?
2021-01-12 23:24:32	MrChainman	I am trying to start spotifyd as a service, no trigger it's just enabled as a service

2021-01-12 23:25:16	MrChainman	I found out the issue lies in having an ecrypted home directory, since systemd cannot start something before it is decrypted and I have it decrypting at login via pam
2021-01-12 23:25:25	MrChainman	I just don't know how to solve this

2021-01-12 23:25:52	towo	Pretty much a no-go if it needs to run as the user, then.
2021-01-12 23:25:58	bf_	MrChainman: then you need to make sure that the service waits for decryption. either busy waiting via some custom shell script or change the dependency of the service
