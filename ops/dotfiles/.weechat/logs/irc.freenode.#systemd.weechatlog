2020-12-21 02:27:31	jbowen	I apologize if this isn't the correct forum, but I'm getting a bit frustrated. I have a service file with one command I want to have run at start up and I can't figure out why it's not running.
2020-12-21 02:27:57	jbowen	Here's the unit file, /etc/systemd/system/smt-mode.service: https://paste.centos.org/view/raw/a4d2e36d
2020-12-21 02:29:30	jbowen	Nothing shows up in journalctl for the service. I also changed standard out/err to write to a file (e.g. /root/smt.stdout.txt) and nothing was written

2020-12-21 03:02:40	Edu4rdSHL	BtbN, what do mean by "thawing"? What's the error?
2020-12-21 03:05:32	Edu4rdSHL	jbowen, do you want to use journal+console instead of syslog+sconsole in StandardOutput, also `journal` instead of syslog in StandardErr.
2020-12-21 03:05:59	Edu4rdSHL	According to the docs, syslog isn't valid there.
2020-12-21 03:06:21	BtbN	Edu4rdSHL, it literally just says "(thawing)" behind the service in the status output.,
2020-12-21 03:07:16	Edu4rdSHL	BtbN, can you paste the output of `systemctl status apache2.service`?
2020-12-21 03:07:41	BtbN	    Active: active (running) (thawing) since Sun 2020-12-20 16:50:52 CET; 2h 16min ago
2020-12-21 03:07:58	BtbN	It appears to be working fine for all I can tell. Just this odd (thawing) right there.
2020-12-21 03:11:11	Edu4rdSHL	It's the only thing I found https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html#thaw%20PATTERN%E2%80%A6
2020-12-21 03:11:23	Edu4rdSHL	But  really doesn't explain anything :p

2020-12-21 04:34:26	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, I mounted/unmounted a disk with dir.mount script but other programs report it as in use. Maybe systemd does not let go of the mount? I enabled forceful mount but that did not help...
2020-12-21 04:34:43	masterboy	foreful unmount...
2020-12-21 04:35:32	masterboy	something is using the disk and systemctl stop dir.mount does not help... :(

2020-12-21 05:03:16	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, as i remember regular mount unmount has no problems after the system boots... but i will doublecheck again
2020-12-21 05:08:31	Edu4rdSHL	masterboy, I don't have much experience with .mount units sincerely.
2020-12-21 05:08:50	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, thanks for looking into it anyway. :)
2020-12-21 05:09:02	Edu4rdSHL	But according to man systemd.mount you're using the right options.
2020-12-21 05:09:25	Edu4rdSHL	Can you confirm damjan's command afer you stopped the .mount unit?
2020-12-21 05:09:33	Edu4rdSHL	`cat /proc/self/mounts`
2020-12-21 05:09:50	Edu4rdSHL	I mean, when other programs reports the disk as busy.
2020-12-21 05:13:20	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, yeah it is gone from mounts but reported as in use nayway
2020-12-21 05:13:42	Edu4rdSHL	But it isn't present in /proc/self/mounts, right?
2020-12-21 05:15:32	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, yes it is not
2020-12-21 05:16:00	grawity	is it present in any other process' /proc/*/mounts, though?
2020-12-21 05:17:11	Edu4rdSHL	masterboy, what's the output for sudo fuser -v -m /dev/sdb ?
2020-12-21 05:17:42	Edu4rdSHL	Well, sudo isn't needed (at least here)
2020-12-21 05:17:46	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, my system is ubuntu core (snap only) there is no fuser
2020-12-21 05:18:53	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, i double checked - regular mount - umount commands work fine after boot,  but this systemd scipt does not
2020-12-21 05:20:01	Edu4rdSHL	No idea. :/
2020-12-21 05:21:23	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, do you know maybe what would be the latest thing systemd boots so i can make the script execute at that time?
2020-12-21 05:22:06	Edu4rdSHL	masterboy, why you don't just put the mount/umount commands in a .service file?
2020-12-21 05:22:17	Edu4rdSHL	I mean, if they're working fine...
2020-12-21 05:22:44	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, right, i have to check how to create that
2020-12-21 05:23:46	Edu4rdSHL	Well, it's pretty simple, put ExecStart=/usr/bin/mount ... and ExecStop=/usr/bin/umount ...
2020-12-21 05:28:29	masterboy	Edu4rdSHL, thanks I will try that in a bit.

2020-12-25 01:08:31	Ultra-77	hi, is there a way to  avoid mount scans with systemd running from user space  `systemd --user`   ... 
2020-12-25 01:08:38	Ultra-77	whenever mounts on system happens  entire server is hit with too much load, since every user of server is running `systemd --user`  all those intances start to scan  mounts and  CPU spikes a lot, 
2020-12-25 01:08:38	Ultra-77	 when you have 200 users  it means entire server  will start to crawl  until  this scan is finished by each and every `systemd --user` process

2020-12-25 01:57:02	bashtanov1	hello, if my daemon changes its main PID, in what order do I notify systemd about it and write it to the pidfile, which systemd is aware of as well?
2020-12-25 01:58:27	grawity	I feel like using both doesn't really make much sense
2020-12-25 01:58:35	grawity	if your service unit is Type=notify, what's the pidfile for?

2020-12-25 02:04:06	quantum	Where do you put .service files, when you have an immutable OS? (can't write most of it)

2020-12-25 02:04:36	quantum	Everyone there tells me /etc/systemd/system, but that should be for runtime only.
2020-12-25 02:04:58	grawity	well, sounds like your OS doesn't play by the usual rules
2020-12-25 02:05:15	grawity	in the rest of the world, /etc/systemd is persistent and /run/systemd is for runtime only
2020-12-25 02:05:28	quantum	Yes, it's a new class. (SilverBlue, MicroOS)
2020-12-25 02:05:40	grawity	I'm guessing yours was specifically made so that you *wouldn't* put custom .service files anywhere
2020-12-25 02:06:18	quantum	We can write /etc (as an overlay), as well as /home, /root, and /var.
2020-12-25 02:06:59	quantum	Ok my mistake, /run/systemd must be runtime.
2020-12-25 02:07:19	grawity	so I would still say /etc, then
2020-12-25 02:07:23	quantum	But where do I put my own .service files, intended for system mode?
2020-12-25 02:07:38	grawity	since that is the whole point of /etc/systemd
2020-12-25 02:08:04	quantum	man says /etc/systemd/user, but when I try to enabe it doesn't see the file.
2020-12-25 02:08:15	grawity	/user is not for system mode
2020-12-25 02:08:48	quantum	So it should be /etc/systemd/system/?
2020-12-25 02:08:55	grawity	yes
2020-12-25 02:09:24	quantum	If /root/.config/systemd/user/ would it run in system mode on boot, and stay alive?
2020-12-25 02:09:35	grawity	no; that's very much not system mode
2020-12-25 02:09:47	quantum	I mean /root/.config/systemd/system/
2020-12-25 02:10:12	grawity	the system service manager will never look for units in homedirs; this is the entire point of --user mode
2020-12-25 02:10:53	grawity	though you *can* arrange for some user's user-mode instance to start on boot and run forever (this setting is stored in /var), but it's still a separate world from system-mode, even if it runs as root

2020-12-25 02:11:18	quantum	It just seems so weird to drop files directly into /etc/systemd/system.  I've always put them into /usr/local/lib/systemd/system.
2020-12-25 02:11:47	grawity	I haven't seen any distro read from /usr/local, is that a local patch?
2020-12-25 02:11:57	quantum	... of course I can't anymore since most of the filesystem is immutable.
2020-12-25 02:12:04	grawity	generally, in systemd, /etc is *specifically* for sysadmin customizations
2020-12-25 02:12:16	quantum	CentOS has always read from local.
2020-12-25 02:12:39	quantum	Ok.  Much respect grawity, thank you.
2020-12-25 02:12:40	grawity	which is also why it stores the "built-in" units in (/usr)/lib which can be part of an immutable /usr
2020-12-25 02:12:44	bashtanov1	grawity: pidfile is anyway used internally. Do you think it's worth just not declaring it to systemd?
2020-12-25 02:18:42	quantum	PS - In my experience SilverBlue 33 is busted.  I'm running/learning MicroOS.

2020-12-25 11:03:38	IniGit	my verdaccio.service cannot create a file within /etc/verdaccio. Do services which need to write to files always have to have root persiomissions? Or what should I do? Tell the service to create the file in an other directory?

2020-12-26 14:43:33	Edu4rdSHL	hyper_ch, it's the first time I see one but seems pretty easy to apply a patch.
2020-12-26 14:43:49	Edu4rdSHL	https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/8a801d431937891960421cfef4cf864302bbb58e/pkgs/os-specific/linux/util-linux/default.nix#L13
2020-12-26 14:44:31	Edu4rdSHL	So, create the .patch file, add the patch name there.
2020-12-26 14:45:11	Edu4rdSHL	I didn't see that they have some "package revisions" item (like pkgrel in arch)
2020-12-26 14:45:46	hyper_ch	well, I just referenced the patchfile from util-linux using fetchpatch ( urs, sha245).....
2020-12-26 14:46:01	hyper_ch	and am rebuilding now before making pr 
2020-12-26 14:47:11	hyper_ch	Edu4rdSHL: https://paste.simplylinux.ch/view/raw/dfbb575a
2020-12-26 14:47:41	hyper_ch	still surprised you know nixpkgs :)
2020-12-26 14:48:49	hyper_ch	the only problem is: I just built it on my homeserver instead of my notebook :(

2020-12-31 11:16:21	twb	oh hrm
2020-12-31 11:16:32	twb	I didn't understand the stuff about "~." in the manpage, I'll reread it
2020-12-31 11:16:33	damjan	~.1.in-addr.arpa
2020-12-31 11:16:51	twb	Oh
2020-12-31 11:17:02	twb	So it's not smart enough to infer that from the routing table?
2020-12-31 11:17:19	damjan	no
2020-12-31 11:17:29	damjan	since DNS is quite removed from routing
2020-12-31 11:18:04	twb	Fair enough
