2020-12-19 11:04:42	James_Epp	pppingme's response explains why I think of them as similar in intelligence better than I could. Pure electronics, no detection of runts/jumbos/giants.
2020-12-19 11:04:45	+pppingme	it does seem like an sfp module does deal with frames if I'm not mistaken, but has no concept of mac's or other ethernet concepts..

2020-12-19 11:08:34	Blondie101010	hi
2020-12-19 11:08:38	+pppingme	Blondie101010 yep, 10 is too slow for 100 to understand, and 100 is too fast for 10 to understand, so you have a bridge between them..  (remember, bridge and switch mean the same thing, with *traditional* use of the term switch to mean multiple ports and bridge mean two ports)
2020-12-19 11:09:06	atsu	That's why hubs drop
2020-12-19 11:09:12	Blondie101010	pppingme: yeah I get that, but I wonder if some hubs might have been able to deal with it through buffering at a certain extent
2020-12-19 11:09:25	Blondie101010	still no switching involved
2020-12-19 11:09:26	atsu	Usually no buffer on a hub
2020-12-19 11:09:47	James_Epp	Do hubs even have logic circuitry?
2020-12-19 11:09:58	atsu	Yes
2020-12-19 11:10:02	+pppingme	most do, but its not really part of the definition of a hub..
2020-12-19 11:10:03	Blondie101010	they handle L2 frames well
2020-12-19 11:10:13	atsu	but they are not MAC aware

2020-12-19 11:10:30	atsu	Like they don't know Sam from Sally
2020-12-19 11:10:38	James_Epp	I always thought of hubs as alligator clips between the conductors, maybe that wasn't the right way to think of them.
2020-12-19 11:10:43	Blondie101010	nope
2020-12-19 11:10:46	atsu	They just blast everything they get in out all ports
2020-12-19 11:10:52	+pppingme	James_Epp close, but diodes involved too
2020-12-19 11:11:11	James_Epp	that's the rub, it has to be isolated somewhat as you mention with diodes to prevent the data coming back the way it came
2020-12-19 11:11:35	atsu	No isolation
2020-12-19 11:11:45	atsu	Everyone is in the same room

2020-12-19 11:12:52	Blondie101010	they handle frames

2020-12-19 11:17:38	James_Epp	I should have just RTFW. This is the extent of hub logic that I was interested in. "It is aware of physical layer packets, that is it can detect their start (preamble), an idle line (interpacket gap) and sense a collision which it also propagates by sending a jam signal"
2020-12-19 11:17:51	Samot	People have stopped responding to his questions because he asks, never follows through and just leaves.
2020-12-19 11:18:34	Blondie101010	James_Epp:  well the start and stop are generated by each client so that's not an important feature for a hub

2020-12-21 01:24:44	samuel	I really don't know I have been through quite a lot of sites now trying to figure this out

2020-12-21 01:25:29	samuel	What I am doing is this: I used UCARP as inspiration to create a redundant server system for industrial automation
2020-12-21 01:25:34	samuel	that all works well
2020-12-21 01:25:59	samuel	but the slaves communicate to the master via websockets
2020-12-21 01:26:05	samuel	all that works well as well
2020-12-21 01:26:36	samuel	BUT I when the network disconnects, the slaves can still communicate but the master no longer accepts connections
2020-12-21 01:26:50	samuel	and I am trying to figure out why
2020-12-21 01:27:03	koollman	I honestly think you should not write (real) redundant network servers if you still wonder about bad routers
2020-12-21 01:27:22	koollman	as an exercise, sure
2020-12-21 01:28:37	samuel	koollman: I know I know... I studied physics, not even computer engineering....
2020-12-21 01:28:58	samuel	but here I am, writing redundant servers and trying to figure out network engineering
2020-12-21 01:29:37	samuel	could you perhaps have a look at this please? http://paste.debian.net/1177721/

2020-12-21 01:29:53	samuel	that bit is the relevant code, it uses asyncio.create_server
2020-12-21 01:30:05	samuel	im not really looking at the nuts and bolts of it all
2020-12-21 01:30:29	samuel	I also dont really want to write a socket server from scratch, but that might be what I need to do
2020-12-21 01:31:39	samuel	problem is that, in python, nobody really talks about the what ifs....
2020-12-21 01:31:48	samuel	its all just assumed to be working
2020-12-21 01:32:27	samuel	especially with asyncio
2020-12-21 01:32:49	koollman	I would start with a smaller test server. you don't know which part is breaking yet

Both are getting about -70 dBm from the AP on the floor below, but latency on the 7260 is consistently low (https://pastebin.com/HGj731j5) while the RT5572 has occasional spikes up to 200 ms (https://pastebin.com/ZjJr9XCr).

2020-12-21 06:27:11	James_Epp	I'm stumped by something I saw earlier today. Two switch stacks, two different vendors. Etherchannel using LACP b/w each. For better or for worse, VLAN 1 is the native/default/mgmt on both and happens to be the VLAN I need shared. If I set the etherchannel to a trunk the frames wouldn't go between the stacks. If I set the etherchannel to an access port, good to go. Any suggestions/guesses as to why?

2020-12-21 06:31:52	James_Epp	I did not do any port mirroring to try to further isolate the problem, I was on pretty limited time to be honest.

2020-12-21 06:32:59	Neutron-sl	well aint that typical. Restarted both the host and client computers, now the client isn't getting an IP from the DHCP, so.. something always gets in the way when troubleshooting something irrelevant
2020-12-21 06:33:25	Blondie101010	James_Epp:  just tcpdump on the destination
2020-12-21 06:33:43	Blondie101010	how else do you test it?
2020-12-21 06:33:49	Neutron-sl	the client PC also has a bad CMOS battery/RTC. And one day it decided not to allow me to set the time/date in windows anymore.. That happened while trying a new browser which needed the time correct for TLS
2020-12-21 06:34:46	Blondie101010	Neutron-sl:  why is that machine not simply replaced?
2020-12-21 06:34:46	James_Epp	Blondie101010, test is from my laptop pinging the SVI / management address of the trouble switch. The MAC tables are hard to describe, they didn't make sense to me either (while it was in a trunk).
2020-12-21 06:36:19	Blondie101010	ok so a client connected to switch A can not ping B's management IP...  can a client connected to switch B ping switch A's management IP?
2020-12-21 06:37:01	Blondie101010	but again, not looking at packets will limit your troubleshooting
2020-12-21 06:37:14	James_Epp	Blondie101010, in this instance switch B's management iface is the only "client" as a member of VLAN 1.
2020-12-21 06:37:45	Blondie101010	the test would have involved adding the client, but anyways
2020-12-21 06:38:18	Blondie101010	if you need to mirror to trace it, I guess that's what you have to do

2020-12-21 06:38:51	James_Epp	I'll admit my troubleshooting wasn't very strong in this instance. I'm still very confused by why an access port worked though and the trunk didn't. Oh well, I'll have to investigate another time.

2020-12-22 08:35:25	Snert	my theory is that the ping is making it there. And it's responding back. It's just that the answer is going over there instead of there it should.

2020-12-22 08:46:14	Blondie101010	the router needs to send the ARP request somewhere
2020-12-22 08:46:44	+tds	if you want, you could totally do keepalived with a floating IP with servers in different subnets, eg have keepalived add/remove the IP on a dummy interface then have the hosts advertise that route via OSPF/BGP/whatever
2020-12-22 08:46:57	FreeBDSM	but ARP requests are broadcasted, so all the router needs is to know which interface to broadcast to, no?
2020-12-22 08:47:17	+tds	but for plain vrrp-style floating IPs, you need both servers on the same L2 so it just looks like a normal host IP that switches mac every now and then

2020-12-22 13:14:43	zumba_addict	or do we have to provide them the cidr?

2020-12-22 13:15:20	kPa	zumba_addict: the point of ddos is to overload something somewhere in the communication path, either the downstream service itself, like the httpd, or the network interface card on the target computer, or any of the switches on the network hops approaching the target
2020-12-22 13:15:24	Samot	Then they will look at who owns those IPs.

2020-12-22 13:26:42	kPa	zumba_addict: the way I'd interpret "intelligently routing" is you can improve performance of the downstream service by using different algorithims for chosing when packets are forwarded and say caching some (albeit briefly) for forwaring later

2020-12-22 20:10:41	ishanjain28	I usually configure my router to redirect _all_ _normal_ dns traffic to my pihole instance to ensure nothing is getting around it. I shared my mikrotik router config with someone, They saw those rules and got really mad and told me, You are not supposed to do that. I have tried googling for downsides of why I shouldn't do this and I haven't found any good reason. :/ What is the opinion here?
2020-12-22 20:11:17	-->	rts64 (~rts64@84.127.189.17.dyn.user.ono.com) has joined ##networking
2020-12-22 20:11:31	ishanjain28	The only downsides that I already know of are, Some stuff may behave erratically like, Vowifi endpoints are supposed to be resolved with LTE provider's DNS servers so it may not work 100% of the time if you use some other resolver
2020-12-22 20:11:50	djph	ideally hand out the preferred resolver via DHCP
2020-12-22 20:12:15	djph	but ... yeah, if you can't trust the clients to not fuck around, a forcible redirect of DNS traffic is kind of necessary
2020-12-22 20:12:32	ishanjain28	djph: Yes, I am also doing that. But some stuff just ignores it. Like, Android phones will use 8.8.8.8 for chromecast, netflix uses google dns for some of it's services and so on
2020-12-22 20:12:48	djph	yep, I know
2020-12-22 20:13:25	ishanjain28	Yeah, So is it okay to have those rules in place? I am done with most of the configuration of my router..
2020-12-22 20:13:40	ishanjain28	Now just need to setup some qos policies
2020-12-22 20:14:03	djph	sure

2020-12-23 11:09:48	Blondie101010	Celmor[m]1's proposed solution could work, but it's much better to use routing instead

2020-12-23 11:10:08	Blondie101010	so no bridge
2020-12-23 11:10:49	Celmor[m]1	depends on the end-goal. as said, usually one uses a separate network namepace where you'd get a virtual ethernet device attached to a bridge and route/nat from that to your default nic

2020-12-23 11:51:21	Blondie101010	KVM is not good for overselling
2020-12-23 11:51:33	Celmor[m]1	overselling what?
2020-12-23 11:51:45	Blondie101010	overloading the host
2020-12-23 11:51:55	Celmor[m]1	hm, RES goes up if I access the terminal so it appears memory usage is dynamic
2020-12-23 11:52:12	Celmor[m]1	"overloading" sounds bad
2020-12-23 11:52:52	Blondie101010	example:  run 4 VMs with 4GB of RAM each on a 8GB host
2020-12-23 11:52:52	cloudcell	I have a question about failed redirect (I hope this is ontopic): I set up apache so that it can successfully redirect http://www.example.com to https://www.example.com, but it fails to redirect when I use http://example.com, (I set up aliases correctly, i think). How can I fix this?
2020-12-23 11:53:08	Celmor[m]1	there's a different term for that
2020-12-23 11:53:22	Blondie101010	maybe, hopefully :)
2020-12-23 11:53:24	Blondie101010	what is it?
2020-12-23 11:53:28	Celmor[m]1	can't recall
2020-12-23 11:53:31	Blondie101010	:)
2020-12-23 11:53:39	Celmor[m]1	english isn't my native language

2020-12-23 11:54:08	Celmor[m]1	Overcommitting perhaps
2020-12-23 11:54:18	Blondie101010	sounds good
2020-12-23 11:54:47	soft_concrete	okay, so I created and started a new container using my bridge interface, and... the container has an IP on my LAN! 192.168.1.197. ...but somehow, the host got a new IP. I guess this is to be expected? is it presenting my router with a new MAC address or something?
2020-12-23 11:54:57	soft_concrete	the MAC for the new bridge interface, perhaps?
2020-12-23 11:55:28	soft_concrete	yes, my router is showing it has a new MAC
2020-12-23 11:55:29	Blondie101010	you can look the DHCP server leases if it can make things more clear
2020-12-23 11:55:31	soft_concrete	interesting
2020-12-23 11:55:34	soft_concrete	I am :)
2020-12-23 11:55:39	Celmor[m]1	usually there's a setting in proxmox for setting your MAC though
2020-12-23 11:55:56	Celmor[m]1	but if you do bridging in your VM that might be different
2020-12-23 11:55:58	Blondie101010	he mentioned "bridge"
2020-12-23 11:56:16	soft_concrete	right, I forgot this is all virtual. I was thinking "how did the MAC address of the NIC magically change?" lol.

2020-12-23 11:56:49	Blondie101010	everything is virtual, especially in an abstract concept like networking
2020-12-23 11:56:57	Celmor[m]1	iirc for linux bridges you'd have to add a device to the bridge with a fixed MAC so the bridge itself can have a fixed MAC as well
2020-12-23 11:57:23	soft_concrete	so that my VM has the same MAC, whether it connects to the router via ens18 or lanbr0
2020-12-23 11:57:46	Blondie101010	did you use to have an IP on the NIP and moved it to the bridge?
2020-12-23 11:58:08	Celmor[m]1	there's the concept of software defined networking that's big in the industry
2020-12-23 11:58:17	soft_concrete	I told the bridge to use dhcp, and it has a different MAC, so the static lease it had when it used ens18 no longer applies
2020-12-23 11:58:23	Blondie101010	ugh, marketing crap
2020-12-23 11:58:44	Blondie101010	soft_concrete:  do you have an IP directly on the NIC?
2020-12-23 11:59:13	Celmor[m]1	well, once you get to the point of virtualizing router devices, switches, multiple networks on the same host, multiple routing tables, etc.
2020-12-23 11:59:34	Blondie101010	there wasn't in your paste, so just checking
2020-12-23 11:59:48	soft_concrete	yeah that paste is outdated
2020-12-23 11:59:53	Celmor[m]1	if the nic is part of the bridge it shouldn't get an IP
2020-12-23 11:59:54	Blondie101010	everything is already virtual

2020-12-23 12:07:32	Celmor[m]1	I'd still put the container on proxmox, ideally even with docker or similar for managing it (e.g. dropping linux capabilities, extra isolation, etc.)
2020-12-23 12:08:37	Celmor[m]1	which alleviates having to administrate 2 linux hosts
2020-12-23 12:09:23	Celmor[m]1	and the service versions, updates. also helps in separating persistent data with binaries/libraries
2020-12-23 12:10:33	soft_concrete	are there any good docs, articles, posts etc. you'd suggest for an introduction to docker? I found this, but it's six years old: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/docker-lightweight-linux-containers-consistent-development-and-deployment
2020-12-23 12:10:58	soft_concrete	has much changed in the last six years with Docker?
2020-12-23 12:11:17	Celmor[m]1	building mostly
2020-12-23 12:11:34	soft_concrete	hmm, dockerfiles sound interesting
2020-12-23 12:11:35	Celmor[m]1	and more advanced instrumentation/orchestration
2020-12-23 12:11:45	soft_concrete	ah ok
2020-12-23 12:11:51	Celmor[m]1	the core concepts should still apply
2020-12-23 12:12:36	Celmor[m]1	I used to recommend this series https://www.nschoe.com/articles/2016-05-26-Docker-Taming-the-Beast-Part-1.html#docker-in-a-sentence
2020-12-23 12:12:48	Celmor[m]1	which is how I started learning it
2020-12-23 12:13:49	Celmor[m]1	for your purposes you should look into docker-compose once you have an understanding of docker itself. there's also the #docker channel if you need any help
2020-12-23 12:14:50	Celmor[m]1	most services (e.g. a lamp "stack") are already available, prepackaged and documented on the "docker hub" which is dockers biggest advantage over lxc IMO
2020-12-23 12:15:42	soft_concrete	that sounds neat
2020-12-23 12:16:25	soft_concrete	when you mentioned having Docker containers running on proxmox, inside an LXC... would you have each docker app running in its own Linux container?
2020-12-23 12:16:40	soft_concrete	not sure what the proper term is here... Docker instance?
2020-12-23 12:17:09	Celmor[m]1	docker container
2020-12-23 12:17:54	Celmor[m]1	each service runs in a container and usually has its own IP, each stack, defined in a docker-compose file usually is connected via a bridge

2020-12-23 12:18:37	soft_concrete	so would you have each docker container running in its own lxc container, which were then all running on proxmox?
2020-12-23 12:18:45	Celmor[m]1	then you "publish" the ports you want to make accessible to the docker host (your lxc container in that case). I've bridged that to the nic of my proxmox so proxmox and the docker host is accessible via their dedicated IPs
2020-12-23 12:19:02	Celmor[m]1	no, docker doesn't use lxc containers

2020-12-23 12:21:37	Celmor[m]1	you can use multiple lxc containers and have a docker host on each for high availability

2020-12-23 12:23:35	Celmor[m]1	its a term used in the enterprise referring to making a service resilient, always available even during updates and providing failover if a host goes down unexpectedly
2020-12-23 12:24:26	soft_concrete	could you give an example of how this could be used? would you have different services running in their own docker container, each in their own LXC, on proxmox?
2020-12-23 12:24:42	Celmor[m]1	docker has builtin mechanisms for using multiple docker hosts and scheduling containers to the available ones and keeping enough "alive" though the more industry standard is kubernetes
2020-12-23 12:25:59	Celmor[m]1	you can have multiple LXC containers, each with a docker daemon installed and connected to each other and it schedules containers over the available ones. this could give you the advantage of updating an lxc container without downtime

2020-12-23 13:05:29	orion	Hi. I have a server in a datacenter, and I've been allocated an IPv6 address. I have native IPv6 at home. If I ping the server from my home machine, I do not receive a response. If however I initiate a ping to google.com from the server, the pings from my home machine succeed.
2020-12-23 13:05:45	orion	I suspect some type of neighbor discovery is not taking place properly. Is this a good assumption?

2020-12-23 18:38:22	earendil	bandwidth is the width of the stream, instanteously

2020-12-23 18:40:51	Dagger	e.g. Wifi uses channels with a frequency band that's 20 MHz wide, hence a bandwidth of 20 MHz

2020-12-23 20:13:10	kerframil	mrjpaxton1: I'd suggest reviewing your ruleset and using tcpdump next. also, you may trace the path of a packet through the ruleset with "nft monitor ruleset". for that to be useful, you must have marked a packet for tracing with a rule that incorporates "meta nftrace set 1".

2020-12-23 20:16:45	mrjpaxton1	I'll take a look at "nft monitor ruleset". I've never heard of that before.

2020-12-23 20:17:49	kerframil	mrjpaxton1: I'm not actually sure that's your problem at this point. connecting with wg isn't supposed to disrupt connectivity to the nexthop router. if it has, that's a problem.

I want windows host to be able to reach 192.168.2.0/24 behind the openwrt router, so I'm setting up "route -p ADD 192.168.2.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.10 IF 7", but when I do ping 192.168.2.15 I don't see any ICMP packet on openwrt eth0.1

2020-12-23 20:45:30	giaco	the problem seem that windows by default set a metric relative to the default route. So if I say metry 5 in route add, it sets it to 40 because default route 0.0.0.0 is 35
2020-12-23 20:46:44	kerframil	koollman: yeah, they are bad. fortunately, conntrack helpers are opt in with nftables. also, recent kernels define net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper=0 by default but I can't remember when that change was made.

2020-12-24 06:40:39	Samian	a new keyword can be the difference between finding or not finding a new world of information
2020-12-24 06:40:48	drmessano	Amazing.
2020-12-24 06:41:04	+imMute	Samian: very true.
2020-12-24 06:41:09	gabbiel	imMute: the vpn that will expose my real ip is the one i have setup with pivpn, mullvad wont has its own ip addresses

2020-12-24 06:42:27	Samian	without the entry points, I can't break into the network of information to learn it all
2020-12-24 06:42:33	+imMute	gabbiel: the pivpn is on your LAN though right?

2020-12-24 06:44:22	drmessano	Samian: All snark aside, I would hope you would only claim knowledge in skills you actually know during a job interview and not "fake it to make it" by Googling shit beforehand.  It could be the difference between getting a job and an interviewer putting your CV in the waste basket.  But I guess that's also trolling
2020-12-24 06:44:49	gabbiel	imMute: the pivpn is the server, just like mullvad and nordvpn have servers
2020-12-24 06:44:52	+imMute	all's fair in resume filtering.   cheating at the actual interview is something else though.
2020-12-24 06:45:03	+imMute	gabbiel: where are you connecting to the pivpn from?  also on the LAN?

The interview prep email from amazon itself says to study design and be prepared to answer question on how to scale solutions to millions of users.  Of course I won't lie saying I've had experience doing it.   Still, if I read about something and understand it, that usually means I can do it if I want to. Case in point: I read about
2020-12-24 06:47:21	Samian	how neural networks worked. After reading and understanding them, I created my own neural network.

2020-12-24 07:17:46	+imMute	for example, I have a great experience with Ubiquiti.  but my network is pretty small and simple.  so maybe I just havn't hit the cases where Ubnt is garbage.
2020-12-24 07:17:58	mrjpaxton	The thing is when I run "wg show" on either device it shows that it's connected peer to peer, but I just can't ping an IP address or hostname, or connect to the Internet at all.

2020-12-24 07:18:55	+imMute	Samot: very true.  in my case, it's ~20 devices, 3 VLANs across two switches and APs.

2020-12-24 07:19:31	Samot	Yeah, that's probably fine
2020-12-24 07:19:41	+imMute	drmessano: so bashing on brands in general is bad.   but if someone asks about using BrandX to do Y and you know that X has difficulties doing Y correctly, then it's okay to say "BrandX sucks at doing Y, you should find something else"
2020-12-24 07:19:55	+imMute	but when it's "BrandX sucks" with no justification... that's unhelpful.

2020-12-25 01:27:15	Peng	The DomainTools "Hotlist" is some kind of statistical model -- I suspect any domain that is new, uses a popular hosting company, and is popular, is at risk of being blocked.
2020-12-25 01:27:22	Peng	Still, I'm told it has a very low false positive rate in practice.

2020-12-25 11:12:10	Peppi	so I have a edgerouter x. I have a computer on 192.168.10.101 and another on 192.168.30.3. I'm using vlans. I have 2 DHCP servers on each sub domain aka .10 and .30
2020-12-25 11:12:56	Peppi	192.168.10.101 can ping 192.168.30.3 and vise versa. The issue is name solution is failing.
2020-12-25 11:13:01	Peppi	how do I resolve this?
2020-12-25 11:13:03	<--	diwyjukjt5 (~vsgKJHgJ~@gateway/tor-sasl/spareproject) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2020-12-25 11:13:45	Peppi	curently on DNS 1 of the DHCP server point to 192.168.10.1 and the other point to 192.168.30.1
2020-12-25 11:14:02	Peppi	DNs 2 is 8.8.8.8
2020-12-25 11:14:21	Peppi	obviously 8.8.8.8 will not resolve a host name on my internal network.
2020-12-25 11:14:46	Peppi	what do I need to do / change in order to get both machine on different subnets to name resolve?
2020-12-25 11:14:58	Peppi	should I point both DNSs to 192.168.1.1 or something?
2020-12-25 11:16:08	Peppi	oh before anyone says I do not want to create static host files :)
2020-12-25 11:16:38	Peppi	also if it isn't obvious by the 192 address I'm doing this at home... this isn't my job lol
2020-12-25 11:16:48	superkuh	Why are they on separate vlan if you want them to communicate?
2020-12-25 11:17:40	Peppi	superkuh, I'm in the process of "hardening" my network. the .30 is the "DMZ" the machine on that network will be exposed to the net

2020-12-25 11:20:03	Blondie101010	what is your local DNS server?
2020-12-25 11:20:22	Peppi	I have 3... I guess

2020-12-25 11:20:53	Peppi	I have 3 DHCP servers 192.168.1.1, 10.1 and 30.1
2020-12-25 11:21:20	Blondie101010	and DNS servers?  are they built-in to the DHCP service?
2020-12-25 11:21:31	Peppi	I'm not sure... I assume so yes
2020-12-25 11:22:02	Blondie101010	how are they set to replicate or exchange data?
2020-12-25 11:22:17	Peppi	I assume they are not... hence the problem
2020-12-25 11:22:57	Peppi	could I just point the DNS 1 on all the dhcp server to 192.168.1.1?

2020-12-26 09:19:42	toy	iirc, that's correct James_Epp
2020-12-26 09:20:02	fakuve	How are you masters of the new digital highways? , I just have a question. I'm trying to USB tether my phone connection into a linux host which only has "systemd-networkd" , it looks like it has a problem getting the DHCP leases, and I think it may be cause `systemd-networkd` now uses its own DHCP client, using `/etc/netplan` module which store interface connection atributes on
2020-12-26 09:20:04	fakuve	/etc/netplan/interface-example-wlan0.yaml
2020-12-26 09:20:11	rrn	James_Epp, well that can't be, otherwise a link consisting of merely straight-through cannot exist
2020-12-26 09:20:33	James_Epp	rrn, can you please expand your reasoning with an example?
2020-12-26 09:20:47	fakuve	the issue is that I pop into this yaml and it uses a MAC Address that is not the same as the one Its get when unplugging-plugging the USB port
2020-12-26 09:20:48	Blondie101010	you guys are simply not understanding each other, though I think you both understand how wiring is done
2020-12-26 09:21:06	fakuve	What is randomizing this `usb0` MAC address?
2020-12-26 09:21:25	fakuve	Is it the linux host? or the phone tether?
2020-12-26 09:21:44	Blondie101010	fakuve:  your NIC on a USB interface, maybe?
2020-12-26 09:21:54	fakuve	Blondie101010: I believe so
2020-12-26 09:21:56	Blondie101010	possibly a wireless adapter
2020-12-26 09:21:57	rrn	James_Epp, Why can't a PC's Ethernet twisted-pair NIC's 8P8C socket have the same pinouts as that of a switch or router?
2020-12-26 09:21:58	toy	well if you have devices A and B you have to pair your TX and RX on each device so TX.A is paired with RX.B and RX.A is paired with TX.B hmm
2020-12-26 09:22:22	fakuve	Blondie101010: it is a USB tethered connection , so Its `wlan0`
2020-12-26 09:22:30	rrn	toy, yes, and that's what a single instance of a crossover cable in the link would accomplish
2020-12-26 09:22:39	James_Epp	rrn, do host devices and switches really have different pinouts?
2020-12-26 09:22:42	Whiskey`	er, port pinouts havent been an issue, ever
2020-12-26 09:22:57	Whiskey`	thats why you have A nad B wired jumper ends
2020-12-26 09:23:00	fakuve	Blondie101010: I try to get a dhcp lease by using `dhclient` but no luck on receiving a DHCP acknowledge
2020-12-26 09:23:15	Blondie101010	fakuve:  I don't follow you as you make no sense...  wlan0 is definitely not a USB *tethered* interface of any kind
2020-12-26 09:23:28	rrn	James_Epp, then why can a link consisting of merely one straight-through cable exist?
2020-12-26 09:23:36	fakuve	Blondie101010: 0h sorry , typo , tipo , usb0
2020-12-26 09:23:42	Blondie101010	fakuve:  you give too much context and junk, but not enough details
2020-12-26 09:23:50	Whiskey`	rrn: auto mdi-x
2020-12-26 09:23:54	rrn	James_Epp, if there was no distinction, tx would be connected to tx, and rx would be connected to rx
2020-12-26 09:23:58	Blondie101010	fakuve: what is the problem?
2020-12-26 09:24:01	toy	hmm yes, they did... I have a really old router/switch combo that has an 'uplink' button that mechanically swaps the RX/TX pinouts on one of the ports to allow for daisy-chaining without a crossover cable before the auto-mdix/mdx
2020-12-26 09:24:04	rrn	Whiskey`, again, ignore autosensing capability
2020-12-26 09:24:18	Whiskey`	rrn: i didnt see that, so its not 'again'
2020-12-26 09:24:18	fakuve	Blondie101010: so basically I'm not getting an IP from the USB router
2020-12-26 09:24:26	James_Epp	rrn, I think I understand your question but I'm not qualified to answer it. I'm going to have to go back to my basics on that one.
2020-12-26 09:24:30	Whiskey`	with out auto mdi-x, you have to wire one end A nad one end B
2020-12-26 09:24:31	fakuve	Blondie101010: not getting any connection at all
2020-12-26 09:24:35	Blondie101010	fakuve:  what is that USB router?
2020-12-26 09:24:39	Whiskey`	so that TX -> RX nad RX -> TX
2020-12-26 09:24:42	rrn	Whiskey`, that's obvious, but I'm talking pre-autosensing
2020-12-26 09:24:56	fakuve	Blondie101010: well is an Android phone with the feature of USB tethering activated
2020-12-26 09:25:05	fakuve	Blondie101010: it normally works on linux
2020-12-26 09:25:17	Blondie101010	fakuve:  and what did you change then?
2020-12-26 09:25:27	fakuve	Blondie101010: but this distro is an "openmediavault" install on a raspberry pi
2020-12-26 09:25:44	Blondie101010	so stop giving useless information!
2020-12-26 09:25:51	fakuve	Blondie101010: its got a primitive `systemd-networkd` daemon serving the connections
2020-12-26 09:25:55	Blondie101010	I don't care where it works if that's not YOUR context
2020-12-26 09:26:13	fakuve	Well I'm not sure what it may be relevant or not
2020-12-26 09:26:14	rrn	James_Epp, it makes sense to have DTE/DCE distinction for RS-232 over the DE series b/c the connectors aren't hermaphroditic
2020-12-26 09:26:26	fakuve	I'm not gonna tell you what I had for dinner

2020-12-26 09:28:49	rrn	James_Epp, wait, never mind, RS-232 over d-subminiature can theoretically be designed like Ethernet cabling
2020-12-26 09:29:32	rrn	James_Epp, so e.g., any sort of RS-232 D-subminiature interface would be female, and the cable would be male--male and utilize crossover
2020-12-26 09:29:54	James_Epp	rrn, does this section help you in any way? specifically the second paragraph? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-dependent_interface#MDI_vs._MDI-X

2020-12-26 09:33:40	rrn	James_Epp, to be able to connect the nodes with each other, one can use a straight-through cable, but then there would need to exist two classes of node, one with the pinouts arranged as tx rx, and one with them arranged as rx tx

2020-12-26 09:36:24	rrn	James_Epp, So why wasn't this obvious approach done for neither RS-232 over D-sub nor Ethernet over twisted-pair?
2020-12-26 09:37:09	Blondie101010	rrn:  because the solution was not yet defined
2020-12-26 09:37:27	James_Epp	rrn, would you say it's fair to assume that there are two different "classes" of network devices - one being transport, and one being destination/source?
2020-12-26 09:37:29	Blondie101010	do you understand that knowledge doesn't magically appear in libraries instantly?

2020-12-26 09:38:18	fakuve	letme check
2020-12-26 09:38:26	fakuve	I forgot this command
2020-12-26 09:38:40	James_Epp	I think serial might be a bad example because it's always point-to-point. Ethernet is multipoint-to-multipoint. You need to have a distinction between the roadways and the destinations (houses/buildings/structures).
2020-12-26 09:39:00	rrn	James_Epp, logically yes, though e.g., a printer would report status; but why have a practical distinction at all?
2020-12-26 09:39:17	Blondie101010	rrn:  no one will really put any effort in improving RS232 today unless it can beat Ethernet
2020-12-26 09:39:39	rrn	James_Epp, Ethernet can be multipoint??  I thought that was only thinnet and thicknet...
2020-12-26 09:39:44	James_Epp	rrn, Well in fact, I think you're right to consider that a switch has a different 8p8c pinout than say a host computer. I've just never given it thought.
2020-12-26 09:39:49	James_Epp	idk the terms thin/thicknet
2020-12-26 09:39:59	rrn	Blondie101010, RS-232 is extensively used
2020-12-26 09:40:18	rrn	James_Epp, well thinnet and thicknet use a coax cable as a common bus
2020-12-26 09:40:38	Blondie101010	how fast can it go now?  400K top?
2020-12-26 09:40:58	rrn	James_Epp, I have never seen an Ethernet over twisted pair standard that enabled the use of the twisted pairs as a bus
2020-12-26 09:41:09	fakuve	Blondie101010: Yeah I just assigned the ip and it looks like the NIC its getting it but It doesnt get connectivity

2020-12-26 09:41:17	rrn	Blondie101010, some applications do not need anything faster than 1,200 baud/s
2020-12-26 09:41:36	Blondie101010	rrn:  I didn't say the opposite or that it wasn't used or useful
2020-12-26 09:41:46	Blondie101010	but still not something worth improving
2020-12-26 09:41:54	fakuve	Blondie101010: well not holdon wait , I get now
2020-12-26 09:42:01	rrn	Blondie101010, but they do need EMP-resistance and an MTBF of thousands of years
2020-12-26 09:42:10	fakuve	forgot to bring up the device lol
2020-12-26 09:42:26	toy	iirc, the main benefit of rs232 is the hardware for it is relatively simple and super cheap when you don't need the performance of ethernet
2020-12-26 09:42:43	James_Epp	rrn, I'm far out of my wheel-house on this one but I've found an O'reilly publication "ethernet: the definitive guide" that might be worth your time.
2020-12-26 09:42:44	Whiskey`	James_Epp: serial is hardly always ptp, rs485 can do a bus
2020-12-26 09:42:54	Blondie101010	fakuve:  well if that connects you, then you either made a mistake with the DHCP client config or you have a problem you the phone's DHCP server
2020-12-26 09:42:55	James_Epp	Whiskey`, I stand corrected then.
2020-12-26 09:42:56	fakuve	Blondie101010: Issue is now I dont have WAN connectivity cos there is no default route setted for this device

2020-12-26 16:53:43	mlu	equipment fee: $25/mo for a used Ciena 3930
2020-12-26 16:53:47	dirtwash	send even  guy, for free
2020-12-26 16:54:08	mlu	tried asking them about using our own SFP module: answer was no, they use that router to determine if they were meeting the SLA
2020-12-26 16:54:23	dirtwash	monthly fees are crap
2020-12-26 16:54:59	dirtwash	but the dystopia we're slipping into...own nothing, rent everything
2020-12-26 16:55:00	mlu	all a question of: is it managed or unmanaged, and is the total service reasonable
2020-12-26 16:55:53	dirtwash	Blondie101010: how do cost for dedicated servers and such compare between canada and US? if you know
2020-12-26 16:56:00	xingu	mlu: did you ask how much lower the service fee would be if you waived the sla?

2020-12-26 16:56:05	xingu	(I would've)
2020-12-26 16:56:06	mlu	also, here's the other thing: I could rent a modem from Comcast for $5/mo (for the gigabit over DOCSIS) -- it's actually a competitive option if you think about the costs of that modem
2020-12-26 16:56:26	mlu	xingu: I was already at their minimum for the dedicated fiber service
2020-12-26 16:56:34	mlu	xingu: the SLA was only 3.5 nines
2020-12-26 16:56:49	dirtwash	mlu: how much is the cost of the modem?
2020-12-26 16:57:07	mlu	dirtwash: the one you can rent for $5/mo costs something like $250
2020-12-26 16:57:22	dirtwash	but most likely you'd pay for a few years no?
2020-12-26 16:57:28	xingu	mlu: co-bundling services like that falls foul of competition law in a few jurisdictions just fyi. :)
2020-12-26 16:57:33	mlu	so, if you plan to use it for 3yr and bet that you'll need to upgrade, it actaully makes sense
2020-12-26 16:57:48	dirtwash	doesnt?
2020-12-26 16:57:56	mlu	3yr at $5/mo is $180 < $250
2020-12-26 16:58:06	dirtwash	yea but the 180 are gone

2020-12-26 16:58:18	dirtwash	its just converted
2020-12-26 16:58:24	mlu	oh sure, but what are you gonna do with an outdated modem? (unless you're geeky enough to be on here :P)
2020-12-26 16:58:41	dirtwash	well point is they making a profit of the renting too
2020-12-26 16:58:48	mlu	average person can't even figure out the model number of their modem
2020-12-26 16:58:54	mlu	it goes both ways :)
2020-12-26 17:00:08	dirtwash	yea well its messed up, how does it work with fiber?
2020-12-26 17:00:15	dirtwash	do u get a modem there too, or how does it connect

2020-12-26 17:02:12	dirtwash	those things cost 30bucks
2020-12-26 17:03:15	mlu	a gigabit-capable router for $30? hmm
2020-12-26 17:03:20	dirtwash	The way they did it here where I live is the smartest I seen so far, basically the fiber terminates at a switch in the basement of the building and theres RJ45 to all apartments, like an office
2020-12-26 17:03:30	dirtwash	so you literally just plug in ur lan cable in the wall and get IP from the switch
2020-12-26 17:03:35	dirtwash	stupid simple, works
2020-12-26 17:03:38	mlu	that's how it's usually done here in the city, but it's not advertised as fiber
2020-12-26 17:03:47	mlu	it's just advertised as "gigabit"
2020-12-26 17:04:02	mlu	none of those providers require you to rent any equipment or even suggest any equipment
2020-12-26 17:04:04	dirtwash	mlu: ok gigabit might cost more
2020-12-26 17:04:12	dirtwash	never had to deal with gigabit before
2020-12-26 17:04:30	mlu	the price tends to skyrocket once you're above ~250mbit
2020-12-26 17:04:47	dirtwash	but what we talking about now, normal wifi router or your fiber endpoint thing
2020-12-26 17:04:59	mlu	i.e. I personally use an Ubiquiti ER-4 with my 1g/1g service here -- about 300 units share a 10gbit backhaul
2020-12-26 17:05:23	mlu	they actually tend to cost similar, but a gigabit capable wifi router tends to be at least $150
2020-12-26 17:05:40	mlu	the fiber endpoint for GPON (ONT) is actually surprisngly cheap: $100/ea

2020-12-26 20:39:04	mibka	I actuallu just want to attach 12x 3.5" SAS disks to a Dell R730XD (24x 2.5") for storage. It doesn't really have to be a dell powervault and with this info I guess I'm better of searching for some other brand device.
2020-12-26 20:39:40	mibka	Main concern is power consumption and as light  said, the powervaults aren't exactly low power.... Any suggestions are welcome :)
2020-12-26 20:39:50	light	R730XD will take non-dell disks without issue
2020-12-26 20:40:29	light	the power consumption isn't so bad on them either, as long as you don't put powerful xeons in it
2020-12-26 20:40:34	light	they have a low power mode
2020-12-26 20:40:55	mibka	Yes, but it's 24x2.5" where I have SSD's installed now. I want to add 12x 3.5" SAS disks for big storage. And it's a home project so power consumtion and noise levels are important factors.
2020-12-26 20:41:12	mibka	Maybe it's a good idea to buy a second R730XD with 12x3.5" instead of a das enclosure?
2020-12-26 20:41:12	light	fair enough

2020-12-27 10:14:50	Lutin	depends... I wonder if people really trade that fast and cash out that big.. why ? If everone does, and BTC can only do a couple of trades per second worldwide, things get stuck again and everyone loses money, blablabla... and we are back where we started because BTC has no real value, it has an illusion and then you get your money the illusion is gone and otherwise your money is gone. So.

2020-12-27 10:20:59	Samot	Then why is it so skewed?
2020-12-27 10:21:03	Dagger	so if you're going to say it's a bad currency, then, well... yeah. it's not meant to be a currency in the first place

2020-12-27 10:21:25	James_Epp	I don't understand, Dagger. Is there some attribute in the ledger that defines the currency used?
2020-12-27 10:21:48	James_Epp	it seems the reward given to miners is in fact measured as a currency
2020-12-27 10:22:19	Lutin	javi404 not really actually, they also take off the market, even drugs kartels do for us :)
2020-12-27 10:22:47	Lutin	James_Epp are there still those chinese miner farms ? I doubt it
2020-12-27 10:23:27	Dagger	it may bear some similarities to currencies, but Bitcoin is designed for making payments between two people, not for being a currency
2020-12-27 10:24:00	Lutin	Dagger bullshit
2020-12-27 10:24:01	Samot	But I can only get bitcoin by mining it

2020-12-27 10:27:04	Dagger	ten bucks of bitcoin is ten bucks of bitcoin, regardless of whether that's 5 mBTC or 50000 BTC

2020-12-27 10:28:40	Samot	How?
2020-12-27 10:28:44	Samot	Where do I convert that?
2020-12-27 10:28:51	Dagger	buy it off of someone
2020-12-27 10:29:01	Samot	That's not a payment processor
2020-12-27 10:29:08	Samot	That's not a replacement for paypal.
2020-12-27 10:29:28	James_Epp	You do know when you buy something off of someone that means it's a good, right? Currencies are goods. You're going in circles.
2020-12-27 10:29:33	Samot	That's like me paying for gold in a video game.
2020-12-27 10:29:54	Dagger	you can pay in bitcoin without dealing in bitcoin yourself by going through a third party. imagine a "pay with paypal" button during checkout, but it's actually "pay with bitcoinpal", and bitcoinpal handle all the bitcoin side of things for you

2020-12-27 10:31:42	Dagger	I know there are services that handle the other side for merchants: users transfer bitcoin to the payment provider, and the payment provider transfers USD-or-whatever into the merchant's bank account (so websites can accept bitcoin payments without ever dealing with bitcoin itself)
2020-12-27 10:31:57	jaakkos	They = payment services built around bitcoin. I seem to think that the adoption was maybe higher around 2015-ish

2020-12-27 10:32:16	James_Epp	I still don't see how something like bitcoin isn't a currency. Miners are rewarded with fixed amounts of the internal "proxy currency" or whatever you want to call it. Humans consider those rewards valuable.
2020-12-27 10:32:32	Dagger	James_Epp: various aspects of its design make it a bad currency. and that's fine, because it's not meant to be one in the first place

2020-12-30 21:07:30	dminuoso	(since your laptop represents a single host/ip address/node/system)
2020-12-30 21:07:34	Apachez	this is just wrong! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw

2020-12-30 21:09:37	dminuoso	But both have internet
2020-12-30 21:09:50	dminuoso	Then you could set up a vpn to sort of "connect" both networks. That'd be called a site-to-site
2020-12-30 21:10:03	Apachez	site to site often implies tunneling
2020-12-30 21:10:04	dminuoso	(Since the VPN doesnt just connect a single host/ip address/node/computer but an entire site)
2020-12-30 21:10:09	Apachez	you tunnel shit from site A to site B
2020-12-30 21:10:23	Apachez	vlantags and the whole shebang often (but not always depending on if its L2 or L3 transport)
2020-12-30 21:10:51	dminuoso	needle: Think of site-to-point inducing a /128 route on the site part, and site-to-site induces larger routers, say an entire /48
2020-12-30 21:11:05	Apachez	site to site with encrypted vpn becomes just like you had a single cable between two routers or switches
2020-12-30 21:11:12	dminuoso	(so site-to-point tunnels a single host, site-to-site tunnels an entire network)
2020-12-30 21:11:29	needle	So this site-to-site is a geographical thing perpective with entities on top of that.
2020-12-30 21:11:43	dminuoso	mmm, that's not really the right focus
2020-12-30 21:11:56	dminuoso	the point is, with site-to-site you tunnel between entire sites/networks

2020-12-30 21:12:26	Apachez	and often by the client itself
2020-12-30 21:12:41	Apachez	normally you call those just "client-VPN"

2020-12-30 21:12:59	needle	OK. That I understand dminuoso.
2020-12-30 21:13:22	dminuoso	needle: the context is usually a VPN which tunnels over some other network. With site-to-site you have say a /48 on one side and a /56 on the other side, tunneled together.
2020-12-30 21:13:40	dminuoso	needle: with a point-to-site you have a /128 on the left, and say a /48 on the right

2020-12-30 21:16:55	Apachez	mostly its marketing buzzwords
2020-12-30 21:17:30	Apachez	site-to-site means that you interconnect lets say 2 datacenters with each other, normally by tunneling and normally by encrypted tunneling (aka encrypted vpn)
2020-12-30 21:18:05	Apachez	so you do this on network level like router or vpn box at site A setup a tunnel towards router or vpn box at site B
2020-12-30 21:18:12	Apachez	the hosts doesnt know its being encrypted
2020-12-30 21:18:32	Apachez	the other method is when the host itself setup an encrypted tunnel towards a vpn concentrator
2020-12-30 21:19:04	Apachez	then the network in between just pushes packets and dont do any encryption since the encryption is handled by the host itself and the concentrator it connects to
2020-12-30 21:19:20	Apachez	when it comes to point to point thats often physical connections
2020-12-30 21:19:55	Apachez	but technically they can be logical aswell.. it just states that the other end of this interface is another box and not multiple boxes as you get with point to multipoint

2020-12-30 21:20:29	Apachez	and fullmesh can either be physical or logical or both
2020-12-30 21:20:53	Apachez	logical as in the box have a single uplink but it will terminate the tunnels from all the other boxes reachable over this network like wan or internet
2020-12-30 21:21:21	Apachez	so these terms are more like inclusive rather than exclusive

2020-12-30 21:23:07	Apachez	or like two rings interconnect with each other etc
2020-12-30 21:23:38	Apachez	site-to-site is to define that you move traffic on network level between two different sites (geological places)

2020-12-30 21:24:56	Apachez	yeah and you often define them inclusive rather than exclusive
2020-12-30 21:25:15	Apachez	for example you got a paper and try to call your site A to site B traffic for something and it in that case ends up with site-to-site
2020-12-30 21:25:29	Apachez	it doesnt mean that "site-to-site" have a hard limit of what it is and what it isnt

2020-12-30 22:06:37	drac_boy	what any of you think of network-rather-than-video type of security dvr setups? (that is cat cable instead of bnc/composite cable etcal)
2020-12-30 22:07:03	Apachez	dminuoso: sure but anything in hardware can be done in software, vxlan is still a l4 technology wrapping l2 frames :)
2020-12-30 22:07:22	NyB	drac_boy: are the cameras IP cameras, or just sending analogue over CAT?
2020-12-30 22:07:46	dminuoso	Apachez: its not a l4 technology.
2020-12-30 22:07:50	drac_boy	niyb whats the usual default?
2020-12-30 22:07:51	dminuoso	it'd be l5+ at best.

2020-12-30 22:13:46	dminuoso	Apachez: VXLAN interacts exactly with the UDP layer, just like the UDP layer interacts exactly with just IP. VXLAN is as much layer 4, as UDP is layer 3.
2020-12-30 22:13:51	NyB	drac_boy: but their app has a LAN mode, so it's not completely locked down.

2020-12-30 22:14:02	dminuoso	The fact that UDP is locked to IP, does not make UDP a layer 3 protocol, wouldnt you agree?

2020-12-30 22:19:26	drac_boy	beside onvif (I almost forgot about that as its been several weeks I last looked more into this) just curious if you think that specific fps would matter much if it was suppose to capture passing car plates etc?

2020-12-30 22:23:18	dminuoso	Apachez: c.f. with BGP. Clearly BGP is a layer 7 protocol too.

2020-12-30 22:24:04	dminuoso	the fact that its rfc locked to TCP and port 179 is completely irrelevant

2020-12-31 07:50:49	Samot	Reporting a bug for CentOS 7 does not impact RHEL 7
2020-12-31 07:50:55	Samot	It has nothing to do with it.
2020-12-31 07:51:17	Samot	CentOS is not a clone of RHEL
2020-12-31 07:51:34	+pppingme	um, HUH???  it sure as **** is..
2020-12-31 07:51:36	Blondie101010	but if RH controls CentOS, why do they ask them to fully backport all changes and rebrand it?
2020-12-31 07:51:40	light	it basically was an unbranded RHEL
2020-12-31 07:51:53	Samot	No it is not a source for source clone.
2020-12-31 07:51:57	Samot	It's derived.
2020-12-31 07:52:14	light	it was essentially the same thing
2020-12-31 07:52:25	drakonan	yes doesnt it miss some kernel patches too?
2020-12-31 07:52:29	drakonan	and i thought they were getting rid of it
2020-12-31 07:52:40	+pppingme	source for source, that includes full match of patches and everything, resulting in a 100% identical binary except for signing keys
2020-12-31 07:52:52	Samot	The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
2020-12-31 07:53:09	Samot	Straight from the first line of the "About CentOS Project"
2020-12-31 07:53:14	Samot	Derived
2020-12-31 07:53:20	light	is that your argument?

2020-12-31 07:53:35	Samot	Doesn't really matter.
2020-12-31 07:53:38	Samot	It's moot at this point.
2020-12-31 07:53:42	+pppingme	I don't think that changed after the (takeover / merging / control)
2020-12-31 07:53:43	Blondie101010	well they just don't import the RH source code...  that's a fact
2020-12-31 07:54:29	light	i have a lot of centos 8 servers, this is going to be a pain in the butt ._.
2020-12-31 07:54:30	drakonan	yeah esp after this its definitely more false now: https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/
2020-12-31 07:54:38	drakonan	centos /= to rhel
2020-12-31 07:54:45	Lutin	What is the disucssion ? Do we agree with Samot his new Chicky or not ?
2020-12-31 07:54:55	drakonan	its going to be tracking ahead of rhel
2020-12-31 07:54:56	Samot	What?

2020-12-31 10:19:51	Weez	Hi guys, im having an issue im not sure how to fix, i suspect i have an ip conflict and its brought my network to a halt. Ive run lanscan and i can see all the ip addresses that lanscan returns but it doesnt show any duplicates so im not sure where to begin, i have 123 ip addresses on the lan. ive got about 30 that are static all below .100 and my dhcp range on my router is set from 100-249 so my issue is somewhere in
2020-12-31 10:19:51	Weez	 that range.

2020-12-31 10:35:53	Apachez	next!
2020-12-31 10:35:57	Stryyker	I'm sure not everything on the whole network is hardwired
2020-12-31 10:36:08	bewb2	that would seem obscene
2020-12-31 10:36:18	TandyUK	yeah, its usually zwave or similar for that kind of thing
2020-12-31 10:36:19	Weez	Stryyker only about half the ip's are hardwired
2020-12-31 10:36:23	bewb2	i don't think i have 38 light siwtches in my house
2020-12-31 10:36:33	bewb2	then you have a pretty big switch somewhere in your house
2020-12-31 10:36:34	TandyUK	find the controller and reset that
2020-12-31 10:36:37	Stryyker	I'm not talking about ips. I'm talking about the physical network
2020-12-31 10:36:56	Weez	I have a 48 port switch at my patch panel
2020-12-31 10:37:10	Weez	and a few small switches where i didnt run enough cat5
2020-12-31 10:37:14	bewb2	unplug hte whole thing overnight, and turn it on in the morning
2020-12-31 10:37:15	TandyUK	starting at port 1, unplug it
2020-12-31 10:37:23	Stryyker	"i have 123 ip addresses on the lan"
2020-12-31 10:37:37	TandyUK	when your network magically works, whatever is on the end of that cable, is your problem
2020-12-31 10:38:14	Stryyker	Are all the network cables to the patch panel all hardwired?
2020-12-31 10:38:18	Apachez	TandyUK: what makes you think that he will comprehend the 5th time you say the same thing? :D
2020-12-31 10:38:53	Weez	Yes approxiomately 85 of those are wireless and approximately 45 are smart electric switches most are hardwired in the wall and several are plugged into the wall, i can go around and iunplug all the ones that are plug-ins if its easier i will kill the main breaker
2020-12-31 10:39:12	bewb2	ethernet typically has 2 ends, if you can't unplug the lightswitch, you can unplug it at the switching switch
2020-12-31 10:39:13	TandyUK	just backtrack....
2020-12-31 10:39:21	Stryyker	So are all 48 ports on the patch panel used?
2020-12-31 10:39:24	TandyUK	what makes you think the lightswitches are the problem?
2020-12-31 10:39:34	TandyUK	rather than <anything else>
2020-12-31 10:39:50	Stryyker	there is a bit of history that hasn't been told
2020-12-31 10:39:56	Weez	Stryyker yes they are but not all used i have several rooms that are wired but nothing attached to them
2020-12-31 10:40:00	bewb2	probably more than a bit
2020-12-31 10:40:16	bewb2	so if the switch light blinks, unplug it
2020-12-31 10:40:22	Weez	i have lights on about 28 of the ports
2020-12-31 10:40:43	Stryyker	can you get a picture?
2020-12-31 10:41:04	bewb2	i have a real question

2020-12-31 10:41:16	Weez	bewb2 all the light switches are wifi
2020-12-31 10:41:18	Stryyker	because there is a lot of stuff about your network we don't know and you aren't tell us
2020-12-31 10:41:30	bewb2	you litterally just said some were hardwired
2020-12-31 10:42:04	Weez	sorry i meant hardwiresd to the power when he said unoplug the cable i meant i couldnt unplug a cable
2020-12-31 10:42:24	TandyUK	fuck the powe, we are ALL talkign about the NETWORK connections
2020-12-31 10:42:37	bewb2	i have an application that goes out to my webserver and gets a list of addresses, then displays them. my web server is behind cloudflare and it has this caching thing. i updated the list of addressses on the web server, however the application is still listing the old addresses
2020-12-31 10:42:45	TandyUK	and back the fuck up and tell us WHY you think the light switches ahve *ANYTHING* to do wit hyour "problem"
2020-12-31 10:43:20	bewb2	i told cloudflare to purge and rebuild the caching, however it isn't doing that
2020-12-31 10:43:21	Stryyker	bewb2: DNS caching?
2020-12-31 10:43:28	Apachez	because A) he is ignorante or B) he is a moron or C) he is plain stupid or D) he is trolling or E) all above ?

2020-12-31 10:44:08	bewb2	the appliation is going to a text file on the web server, and hte file is changing, but it's not getting hte updated version despite purging cache on cloudflare
2020-12-31 10:44:31	bewb2	i don't think it would be dns caching because it's not looking at a different location for the text file
2020-12-31 10:44:38	Stryyker	misunderstood
2020-12-31 10:44:40	Apachez	Weez: since you are not a "networking expert" perhaps its about time to listen to some of the "networking experts" in this channel?
2020-12-31 10:44:49	Weez	Holy shit, im not saying it has anything to do with my problem i dont know where the fuck the problem lies all i was trying to say is i can unplug all the cables that are hardwired if that will help but i still have 40+ ips i cant unplug a network cable i appreciate the help from tghe few of you who were honbestly trying to help
2020-12-31 10:45:01	Weez	Apachezgo fuck yourself
2020-12-31 10:45:08	bewb2	it's the file itself that has changed. like updating index.html on the website
2020-12-31 10:45:08	Apachez	lol
2020-12-31 10:45:09	TandyUK	weez, just start unplugging ffs
2020-12-31 10:45:20	TandyUK	port 1, does it fix it? no? plug itback in

2020-12-31 11:14:44	bewb2	i used an old client to try and bring a new vps online for testing, and i forgot to hairpin
2020-12-31 11:15:03	bewb2	old client didn't have a hardcoded server list

2020-12-31 11:16:04	Whiskey`	im guessing your local router is doing your dns, or you have a inhouse dns server
2020-12-31 11:16:29	Whiskey`	you tell them that "in lan, gets the lan ip" out of lan, gets the public ip

2020-12-31 11:28:24	zebrag	If you are a server and your are accepting clients through `int s = accept(sockid, &clientAddr, &addrLen);` Then the socket `sockid` is never actually used. Well it really is used once, for some "pinging" purpose. But the data are sent and received through a socket-pair consisting of the client-socket, which has been assigned an address during the operation, and the newly created socket, which by the way has the
2020-12-31 11:28:25	zebrag	same socket-address as the initial `sockid`. There is something wrong in that description, because a new client trying to connect will use the same address that is already assigned to both `sockid` and `s`, and that will be ambiguous.

2020-12-31 12:04:29	mrjpaxton1	Hey, I have some questions about IPv6, because I'm trying to understand it completely, especially since my ISP is not using DS (Dual Stack) but 6rd, so I require tunneling. I've done a lot of research over the past few days. Basically, I want to configure my IPv6 network with the following goals in mind: I want the edge router to send an RA request
2020-12-31 12:04:29	mrjpaxton1	which will get me a static IPv6 address with SLAAC. Secondly, I want all of the LAN devices on the network to either get their own public/private IPv6 ULA address, and be routed and tunnled through the 6rd SIT interface to CenturyLink somehow. Third, I want to be able to ping with ICMPv6 on any device on my LAN to a public IP address easily, with
2020-12-31 12:04:30	mrjpaxton1	"ping -6 ipv6.google.com" for example.
2020-12-31 12:04:33	bewb2	the trencher wasn't specific for the job
2020-12-31 12:04:38	mrjpaxton1	Sorry, that was a lot to type in. :p
2020-12-31 12:04:41	bewb2	fiber rather
2020-12-31 12:05:06	bewb2	but i figure as long as i'm digging holes with it, fiber makes sense
2020-12-31 12:05:35	Samot	That's not how you phrased it.
2020-12-31 12:05:53	mrjpaxton1	Anyway, is there I way I can set up IPv6 well with CenturyLink? I don't want to use a 6rd tunnel for each computer on the LAN unless I have to.
2020-12-31 12:05:54	Dagger	mrjpaxton1: 6rd requires manual setup on the router, since the prefix for it is derived from your v4 address
2020-12-31 12:05:54	Samot	You were talking about running fiber and that you even bought a trencher for it
2020-12-31 12:05:56	rrn	drmessano, Have you encountered folks here from New England whom might be interested in peering over microwave/VHF/UHF/HF?
2020-12-31 12:05:57	bewb2	that wasn't my intention, sorry
2020-12-31 12:06:26	bewb2	i'm also building a garage, i've bought a lot of tools to do that, a trencher is just one
2020-12-31 12:06:34	drmessano	Errrr idk
2020-12-31 12:06:42	Dagger	mrjpaxton1: as for the LAN side, pick a /64 from your 6rd allocation, put <that /64>::1/64 on the router, and send RAs with SLAAC enabled, and your whole network will get addresses
2020-12-31 12:07:18	mrjpaxton1	Dagger: I was using this bash script for pppd that I found here with some adjustments: https://www.jasondavis.net/2020/10/03/CenturyLink-IPv6-6rd.html
2020-12-31 12:07:31	mrjpaxton1	Instead I am using "br-lan" for the lan bridge, basically.
2020-12-31 12:08:06	mrjpaxton1	So that script half-works for me. I am able to use IPv6 ping on ipv6.google.com from the router, but I'm not able to ping from my LAN device.
2020-12-31 12:08:15	mrjpaxton1	So that's the trouble I'm running into.

2021-01-12 23:17:06	dminuoso	;)
2021-01-12 23:17:32	djph	dminuoso: then it'd be grey (unless you can "modem-only" it)
2021-01-12 23:17:33	TandyUK	the fibre CPE's we use are just a glorified Fibre to ethernet media convertr, with some monitorability
2021-01-12 23:17:54	TandyUK	your router (or our provided one) hooks into the ethernet port

2021-01-12 23:18:13	dminuoso	In our FTTH setup, for a lot of reasons, we provide you with a media converter and formally define it as the demarcation point.
2021-01-12 23:18:29	dminuoso	It might sound stupid, but when you deal with residentials, only a small fraction knows how to deal with fiber optics
2021-01-12 23:18:36	TandyUK	and its pure L2, theres only one router behind it
2021-01-12 23:18:38	djph	^
2021-01-12 23:18:39	dminuoso	And there's so few feasible CPEs with builtin tranceivers..
2021-01-12 23:19:00	dminuoso	(low cost, tr069 manageable, muggle friendly..)
2021-01-12 23:19:09	dminuoso	And node
2021-01-12 23:19:12	dminuoso	*note
2021-01-12 23:19:14	dminuoso	Our setup is AON!
2021-01-12 23:19:19	dminuoso	(Yes, it made me cry, but there's just no other way)

2021-01-12 23:19:56	dminuoso	Of course, since it's just AON you can just unplug it from the media converter and plug it into an SFP of your chosing..
2021-01-12 23:20:07	dminuoso	Just need to guess the wavelength. :)
2021-01-12 23:20:28	drzacek	okay, got it, so I'll leave those sfp+ ports free for now, but I'll have them as reserve once I'll need some 10gigabit between something
2021-01-12 23:20:49	dminuoso	drzacek: On my router in the basement, I used the SFP ports for the WAN port...
2021-01-12 23:20:52	dminuoso	Err *switch!
2021-01-12 23:21:00	dminuoso	Not because its faster, but because it looked nice..
2021-01-12 23:21:13	dminuoso	wan comes in a red cable, goes into a fancy looking SFP. looks important that way
2021-01-12 23:21:57	drzacek	k
2021-01-12 23:21:59	drzacek	anyway
2021-01-12 23:22:12	drzacek	how do I power stuff in rack case?
2021-01-12 23:22:26	drzacek	I need some rack mounted wall sockets?
2021-01-12 23:22:37	dminuoso	There is 19" outlets
2021-01-12 23:22:46	dminuoso	vertically and horizontally
2021-01-12 23:22:50	djph	yeah, you can get rackmount powerstrips
2021-01-12 23:23:01	dminuoso	For small 19", just go with a simple 19" horizontal outlet
2021-01-12 23:23:02	djph	or, if it's close enough to a wallsocket ... a wallsocket
2021-01-12 23:23:12	dminuoso	if you have money to burn, get a smart pdu

2021-01-12 23:24:53	drzacek	I can burn something for money tho
2021-01-12 23:25:05	dminuoso	Then the cheapest 19" power strip you can find.
2021-01-12 23:25:14	dminuoso	That you can still live with..
2021-01-12 23:25:26	dminuoso	Personally I found that skimming on electrical equipment has a way of backfiring in bad ways
