2020-12-19 08:16:33	rk4	and what makes the use of a prepared query legitimate?

2020-12-19 08:16:58	xocolatl	executing it enough times to be worth the extra round trips
2020-12-19 08:18:58	peerce	OLD school, like 25 years ago when cpus were much slower, and databases liker oracle took a lot of time in planning, it was common practice to prepare ALL your queries when you connect, then just execute them.
2020-12-19 08:19:16	peerce	but thats never been a good pattern for postgres due to its reliance on data statistics to optimze the planning
2020-12-19 08:19:38	xocolatl	and the fact that it doesn't actually prepare them for a while
2020-12-19 08:19:54	Snow-Man	it kinda half does :)
2020-12-19 08:19:55	peerce	well, I'm pretty sure oracle actually did
2020-12-19 08:20:14	rk4	i notice go's sql libs apparently 'creates prepared statements for you under the covers. A simple db.Query(sql, param1, param2), for example, works by preparing the sql, then executing it with the parameters and finally closing the statement.'
2020-12-19 08:20:30	xocolatl	that's a broken driver
2020-12-19 08:20:42	peerce	some APIs, the sql has to be prepared to make a parameterized query.
2020-12-19 08:20:56	peerce	I think thats true for perl dbd

2020-12-20 03:50:51	hyperknot	To me md5 seems easier, if it's possible. So jsonb::text is always returning in a reliable order?
2020-12-20 03:51:12	hyperknot	I just tried select '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'::jsonb::text = '{"b": 2, "a": 1}'::jsonb::text;
2020-12-20 03:51:16	hyperknot	and it's TRUE

2020-12-20 03:52:50	hyperknot	Zr40: but does it return in a reliable order when ::text is called?
2020-12-20 03:53:04	hyperknot	I'm only caring about uniqueness for md5(jsonb_column::text)
2020-12-20 03:53:26	Zr40	I don't know if that's guaranteed explicitly, but those two jsonb values are indeed identical without the text cast

2020-12-20 03:54:30	Zr40	one case where I can envision it changing is locale changes, or version upgrades
2020-12-20 03:55:15	hyperknot	Zr40: those are not a problem, I just want one table's jsonb keys to be unique
2020-12-20 03:55:25	hyperknot	I mean jsonb columns' values
2020-12-20 03:55:37	Zr40	it will be a problem if those things cause the md5 to be different and therefore permit duplicates
2020-12-20 03:56:36	Zr40	may I ask what you're storing inside this json value if it's so big and also needs to be unique?
2020-12-20 03:56:49	RhodiumToad	jsonb stores values in a way that allows equality comparisons to work.

2020-12-20 04:03:06	Zr40	I'm thinking either it doesn't need to be unique at all, or there's some smaller attribute inside that requires uniqueness (in which case uniqueness of the entire json is incorrect)
2020-12-20 04:04:20	hyperknot	I'm also thinking the same, I'll have to check back if it's really what's needed, or there is a misunderstanding in place.

2020-12-20 18:08:22	scootd	kind of a thundering herd issue, since there is a lot happening at once, but why it would be such a massive difference like that, especially for a simple single row select, is baffling.

2020-12-20 18:22:23	scootd	i mean, yeah the worker is parallelizing the work, about 50 processes going at a time. each job deals with a different entity to sync and then upsert in.
2020-12-20 18:23:35	scootd	the bulk upserts and deletes are not so slow, but some of the simple 1 row selects are.

2020-12-20 18:32:09	scootd	incognito: could it be that every time a new job processes, it opens and closes a connection? would that cause this sort of slowness?
2020-12-20 18:33:05	scootd	if that's the case, then it seems there is only one solution. need to change to a language with better concurrency primitives so that i can do this all while holding a single connection..

2020-12-20 22:25:51	eLJay	Hey guys, I've installed the postgis extension and can create tables using geometry types with the "postgres" user, however with my application user I can't as it doesn't find the "geometry" type.

2020-12-20 22:26:44	eLJay	postgis has been installed into the "public" namespace
2020-12-20 22:29:06	eLJay	any ideas on why that user can't find the geometry type?
2020-12-20 22:37:22	eLJay	using \dx with the user shows no postgis extension, with the postgres user it does
2020-12-20 22:39:04	sobel	i am inserting json to a json column by passing a string and casting ?::json
2020-12-20 22:39:12	sobel	is there something smoother under jdbc?
2020-12-20 22:42:07	eLJay	\dx with the postgres user shows it as being install to public schema, I granted all privs on public to my application user, still no game.

2020-12-21 05:25:59	peerce	doens't sound like something where SQL and relational database is an appropriate solution, at least not without creating a custom extension to do some rather specific sorts of processing with your data.
2020-12-21 05:27:57	RhodiumToad	er
2020-12-21 05:27:59	gist	I suspect you could split of some parts of t3.pronounce to match first3-5 and last3-5. If the names make any sense you might even gain some performance from just checking that the three-parts match.
2020-12-21 05:29:26	RhodiumToad	so, word3 being given, it's obvious that the first element of the word1 array must match that of word3, and the last element of word2 likewise?
2020-12-21 05:30:09	RhodiumToad	even just checking those two explicitly might narrow down the search a fair bit, compared to an O(N^2) crossjoin

2020-12-22 08:35:01	farhan	if a particular SELECT comes back with 0 rows, it retrieves data and INSERT's it into the DB.

2020-12-22 23:43:35	kpiyushlucky	PostgreSQL*
2020-12-22 23:43:50	RhodiumToad	you want the number of complete years between the hiring date and today?

2020-12-22 23:44:06	RhodiumToad	ignoring any fractions?
2020-12-22 23:44:24	kpiyushlucky	yes but not a necessity
2020-12-22 23:44:36	Myon	ah that wasn't a HR question
2020-12-22 23:44:46	kpiyushlucky	have tried age function

2020-12-22 23:45:02	kpiyushlucky	but that is too verbose
2020-12-22 23:45:24	RhodiumToad	age will return an interval, like '3 years 7 months 23 days'
2020-12-22 23:45:40	RhodiumToad	the extract will return just the year part

2020-12-22 23:52:36	kpiyushlucky	would it always be days
2020-12-22 23:52:40	RhodiumToad	for example two dates 30 days apart might be more than 1 month apart, or 1 month apart, or less than 1 month apart

2020-12-23 00:14:09	RhodiumToad	that's a bit better
2020-12-23 00:15:42	RhodiumToad	also you may need to explicitly exclude 1

2020-12-23 13:10:10	peerce	is the table partitioned on this ID, or by something else?

2020-12-23 13:23:19	coderman1	_leadids does not have an index but it only has 100k rows
2020-12-23 13:23:29	peerce	so no primary key??
2020-12-23 13:23:53	peerce	so we're going to do 25 million sequential scans of a 100k row table?  ouch.
2020-12-23 13:24:21	coderman1	so make leadid the pk in _leadids?
2020-12-23 13:24:35	peerce	ALL tables should have a PK, thats a fundamental rule of relational databases
2020-12-23 13:24:49	peerce	the PK should be the minimum unique identificaiton for the table
2020-12-23 13:25:12	peerce	leads.leadid is the PK of leads ?
2020-12-23 13:25:14	coderman1	well in this case _leadids is kind of a temporary table used to store the results found in a search from the front end
2020-12-23 13:25:55	peerce	IS _leadsid.leadsid unique ?
2020-12-23 13:26:02	coderman1	yea
2020-12-23 13:26:16	coderman1	the index being used on leads is : CREATE INDEX leads_p2020_11_leadid_insertdate_idx ON zookeypub.leads_p2020_11 USING btree (leadid, insertdate)
2020-12-23 13:26:21	peerce	pg won't know that if its not delcared as a unique or as a primary key
2020-12-23 13:26:40	peerce	iS leads.leadid unique ?
2020-12-23 13:26:56	peerce	or does the same leadid occur on different dates ?
2020-12-23 13:27:11	coderman1	its completely unique
2020-12-23 13:27:22	peerce	then there's no point in that index you just listed
2020-12-23 13:27:35	peerce	since for a given leadid, there's only ever one insertdate
2020-12-23 13:27:53	coderman1	what about for queries not using leadid but using insertdate? would that index never be used?
2020-12-23 13:28:09	peerce	that would only use an index that STARTS with insertdate
2020-12-23 13:28:12	peerce	or is just insertdate
2020-12-23 13:29:10	peerce	the index you described would only be used if you searched WHERE leadid=$1 AND insertdate </=/> $2
2020-12-23 13:29:13	coderman1	so having insertdate in the index is pointless, not the entire index right
2020-12-23 13:29:29	peerce	well, if leadid is the primary key, then you already have an index on it

2020-12-23 14:53:47	peerce	for example, last $job, our manufacturing databasse, we had a sample of about 8 hours of manufacturing 'event' data, we could feed to the front end in 'catch up' mode, and measured how long it took to crunch.

2020-12-23 14:54:51	peerce	it was considered acceptible if we could do 8 hours of data in 4 hours, but we usually managed to do it in 2 or less.

2020-12-23 14:55:21	peerce	note our front end system would run about twice as many database workers as the db server had cores

2020-12-23 14:55:35	desnudopenguino	basenode: yes. so they are running one after the other
2020-12-23 14:56:06	peerce	oh, the data itself?   no, it came from 1000s of test machines that the 250000 devices being built over 8 hours were run through.
2020-12-23 14:56:16	peerce	those test machines generated events that were sent up stream as messages
2020-12-23 14:56:29	peerce	and our test file was an intercept of those messages
2020-12-23 14:56:52	peerce	so we could play it back with a republisher, the app servers ran about twice as many servers as we had database server cores
2020-12-23 14:57:16	peerce	and those would subscribe to the republished events from the message stream and digest them and do the business logic on them

2020-12-23 15:01:36	peerce	each device being built went through 40 or 50 manufacturing stations ('testers')
2020-12-23 15:02:02	peerce	and each of those stations would check in the device, verify it was OK to proceed, get specs on what to do with it, then do its thing, then report results
2020-12-23 15:02:10	peerce	and each of those things was an event in our system
2020-12-23 15:03:45	peerce	the big factories had run rates of around 1000 events per second under normal operations, and each event tended to result in a database transaction on the front end, various back end workers batching them through til the back end sucked out the digested data and republished it to the reporting servers

2020-12-23 15:12:16	Dar1us	but importantly, what sort of beer? :)
2020-12-23 15:12:30	peerce	hey,  work 45 years, raise two kids to adult, .... um, right now?  A Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale
2020-12-23 15:12:31	peerce	;-p
2020-12-23 15:12:45	peerce	last one was a Santa Cruz mOUNTAIN Brewery Pacific IPA
2020-12-23 15:12:58	basenode	i was about to say IPA :P
2020-12-23 15:12:59	peerce	fuggin capslock on this laptop :-/
2020-12-23 15:13:10	peerce	Celebration is described as a fresh hopped IPA
2020-12-23 15:13:12	Dar1us	I disabled caps lock on mine, useless key
2020-12-23 15:13:16	Dar1us	nice
2020-12-23 15:13:25	Dar1us	I have an IPA brewing now
2020-12-23 15:13:42	peerce	its rather deep red, which I like, good malt body to stand up against massive fresh hop onslaught
2020-12-23 15:13:43	Dar1us	"forced" into full grain brewing after being diagnosed as celiac :-/
2020-12-23 15:13:56	peerce	one ofmy favorites is Arrogant Bastard, which I consider to be a 'red IPA'
2020-12-23 15:14:09	peerce	or i udnno, India Red Ale ?
2020-12-23 15:14:14	Dar1us	some US IPAs are pretty insane.. I worked for a company in Seattle a while ago and you could get some crazy ones there
2020-12-23 15:14:32	peerce	yeah, they are big all over the west coast.
2020-12-23 15:14:51	Dar1us	yeah, well push back from the years of terrible beer you had to suffer I suppsoe 8-)
2020-12-23 15:16:25	peerce	um, been drinking good beer since HS days in the early 70s, Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada and lots of imports.
2020-12-23 15:16:28	basenode	peerce: just off the top of you're head, am I heading in the right direction? I'm scraping a few thousand sites at an interval of 5 minutes (basically time series data), which is managed by a message queue, which saves the formatted data into a postgres instance once the scraper worker is complete. Then i've got a node api which my application server uses to get the latest version of the data.
2020-12-23 15:16:31	basenode	Off the top of your head, do you see any issues with my setup?
2020-12-23 15:16:49	peerce	well, I think Javascript is an abomination
2020-12-23 15:17:09	basenode	lol it's not my preferred choice either, but i need it for the data extraction
2020-12-23 15:17:20	basenode	(specifically for puppeteer)

2020-12-23 15:18:16	Dar1us	peerce: fancy
2020-12-23 15:18:44	Dar1us	does it have pumpkin spice in it? :)

2020-12-23 15:19:31	peerce	but for high trhoughput distributed processing stacks, using a MQ style messaging system is awesome.    you can have as many sources publishing on a 'topic' as you need, then as many worker nodes sa you want subscribing to that topic, and taking the data and turning it into sql transactions, tune the worker count to optimize your db server throughput
2020-12-23 15:19:44	peerce	god, I *HATE* flavored beer.  and pumpkin is about the WORST
2020-12-23 15:20:07	peerce	nah, nothing here but barley, hops, water, and yeast.  some years there's a bit of wheat in the grain bill.
2020-12-23 15:20:29	Dar1us	heh
2020-12-23 15:20:57	basenode	peerce: have you used erlang before?
2020-12-23 15:21:09	peerce	they've been making various annual celebration ales since 1981
2020-12-23 15:21:24	basenode	(or a platform with similar concept to OTP?)
2020-12-23 15:21:25	peerce	always a red hoppy strong ale, but the flavor profiles have wandered around some
2020-12-23 15:21:47	Dar1us	peerce: there are lots of hops to experiment with, it's quite neat how many different flavours they have
2020-12-23 15:21:48	peerce	um, first half of my career I was an assembler and raw C geek, doing OS level device driver programming of bare iron hardware
2020-12-23 15:21:54	peerce	yeah that.
2020-12-23 15:22:09	basenode	ah ok, neat

2020-12-23 15:22:56	basenode	one day i want to teach myself how to do low level programming, first have to read up on compsci fundamentals though
2020-12-23 15:22:59	peerce	then I burned out on that and took a more "IT" kinda job as the OS, storage, and networking guru for a small development group that a former coworker was managing.
2020-12-23 15:23:16	peerce	and really didn't do much more programming, more architecture, troubleshooting, and integration

2020-12-23 15:29:51	peerce	we avoided pub-sub stuff that required dedicated messaging servers in the middle, as that adds a whole other HA headache.
2020-12-23 15:30:56	peerce	we ended up writing our own, and doing the message queueing at the pub nodes, with local disk backup.   if the subscribers were listening, then nothing had to be spooled.
2020-12-23 15:31:35	peerce	we did have to implement a whole monitoring layer to ensure there weren't orphaned subscriptions, as if a subscriber 'vanished' without being unregisterd, then its topics would pile up indefintiely on the publishers
2020-12-23 15:32:26	peerce	we had one old greybeard Java programmer who did all that stuff
2020-12-23 15:32:54	peerce	it worked WAY better than the $$$ commercial pubsub we started with, so other corp departments were asking about it and adopting it :D
2020-12-23 15:33:40	peerce	i wonder how they are doing?   I retired concurrently with my whole department being dissolved.

2020-12-23 15:34:37	peerce	heh.   6 out of 10 of us were grey to white hair old dudes.
2020-12-23 15:34:48	peerce	a major tech manufacturing company
2020-12-23 15:35:19	peerce	40K employee, I forget how many $billion sales.
2020-12-23 15:35:44	peerce	but we were a 25 year old small department buried in an out building at the old corp HQ complex.
2020-12-23 15:35:54	peerce	with like 10 people, boss included.
2020-12-23 15:36:03	peerce	almost zero turnover in the 20 years I was there
2020-12-23 15:36:23	peerce	at leasat 6 of them were there from before me until it was dissolved
2020-12-23 15:36:58	peerce	two younger programmers, 1 java, 1 sql,  who were hired in the 90s moved to other IT departments.
2020-12-23 15:37:50	peerce	the API guy winters in Baja, and has a ridgetop estate in the mountains here where he summers.
2020-12-23 15:38:03	peerce	OT for this chan. solly.
2020-12-23 15:38:07	peerce	-social
2020-12-23 15:39:59	basenode	interesting, something like cisco/sun microsystems/etc? lol and 20 years with zero turnover? is that normal?
2020-12-23 15:43:13	peerce	no, its pretty legacy.
2020-12-23 15:43:27	peerce	but we were a very core part of their manufacturing architecture
2020-12-23 15:43:37	peerce	and manufacturing is a really conservative thing.
2020-12-23 15:44:09	peerce	because you're turning raw materials into money.
2020-12-23 15:44:58	peerce	and 2-3 out of 10 is not zero.
2020-12-23 15:46:13	peerce	our original boss left ages ago, and the #2 who had been off running IT in a irish plant came back and took the group over.

2020-12-23 15:48:37	peerce	and then there was a guy who'd worked for the same company as a manufacturing tech, then left and went to college and got a degree, adn came back as a software guy
2020-12-23 15:49:00	peerce	and landed in our department, since we were the source for the software he had been dealing with as a tech

2020-12-23 17:39:26	esc4rg0t	Why does the use of 'LEFT(field, 50)' in a simple SELECT increase query time that much? 'SELECT name from users' -> 250ms, 'SELECT LEFT(name, 255) from users' -> 450ms...

2020-12-23 17:43:14	esc4rg0t	azeem: Well, the funny thing is that if I do a 'SELECT' without 'LEFT' and truncate on the API server, I barely see a difference to a 'SELECT' without truncating. But when I use 'LEFT' on the SQL server, truncating almost doubles the request time because the query takes that much longer.

2020-12-23 17:51:20	esc4rg0t	Berge, But I would assume that Postgres did not 'LEFT' on all the records in the table with OFFSET/LIMIT.
2020-12-23 17:51:39	Berge	esc4rg0t: LIMIT without ORDER BY is meaningless
2020-12-23 17:51:46	Berge	So you'll get undefined results anyway.
2020-12-23 17:52:02	Berge	But postgres should only call LEFT() on those 50 rows.

2020-12-23 18:01:19	esc4rg0t	Berge, The performance issue I've seen using the API server is more pronounced for large offsets. And that comes down to the fact that the server does a 'LEFT' on all the previous rows too I imagine, until OFFSET is reached. So that's extra overhead I don't have if I do truncating on the API server directly.

2020-12-23 18:03:50	azeem	basenode: with logical replication?
2020-12-23 18:04:15	azeem	it's a bit unclear whether you want to change the database name and/or the table name
2020-12-23 18:04:20	esc4rg0t	Berge, If I do the query using 'LEFT' from the API server, I get response times of 1.2 seconds in the web API. If I remove the 'LEFT' and truncate myself, the response time comes down to 350ms.
2020-12-23 18:04:30	esc4rg0t	Berge, So that's why I think it's the 'LEFT'.
2020-12-23 18:04:33	basenode	not sure, don't really know anything about the topic, but i want to access a single table (in real time) of my api pg instance on the application instance

2020-12-23 18:05:13	esc4rg0t	avemestr, yes, that's an idea.I guess I will have to optimize query building a bit to account for that.
2020-12-23 18:05:16	Berge	esc4rg0t: Run both queries in psql and see if you can replicate the results.
2020-12-23 18:05:22	azeem	basenode: maybe use postgres_fdw then
2020-12-23 18:05:27	basenode	so this is my use case: i have an application server that has its own PG instance, and an api server that also has a pg instance. The api server inserts data into its PG instance, and i want to be able to access this data (in a single table) from my application instance in real time
2020-12-23 18:05:49	basenode	i.e. if a new entry is created in my api pg instance, this should immediately be visible to my application instance
2020-12-23 18:05:54	esc4rg0t	avemestr, yes, that's an idea.I guess I will have to optimize query building a bit to account for that.
2020-12-23 18:06:07	esc4rg0t	oops.
2020-12-23 18:06:36	Berge	esc4rg0t: Only if the problem is indeed what you think it is.
2020-12-23 18:07:18	esc4rg0t	Berge, yes. Well, let me post the query plans / explains.
2020-12-23 18:07:22	basenode	like what is the correct way of doing this?

2020-12-23 18:12:22	esc4rg0t	Berge, But for measuring that shouldn't influence anything, right?
2020-12-23 18:12:46	FunkyBob	esc4rg0t: sql is under no obligation to give you records in any particular order if you don't specify one ... it doesn't even have to yield the same order for the same query repeated, AIUI
2020-12-23 18:12:56	FunkyBob	ordering is a huge potential cost
2020-12-23 18:13:03	Berge	esc4rg0t: Of course it will.

2020-12-23 18:13:56	FunkyBob	especially if you don't have an index to help the ordering, it could require a full table scan

2020-12-23 18:25:32	Berge	Or consider adding LEFT(email_to, 250) to the covering index, I suppose?
2020-12-23 18:25:53	FunkyBob	was about to suggest something similar
2020-12-23 18:26:00	FunkyBob	covering index is even better idea :)
2020-12-23 18:26:08	Berge	Won't ever be very fast with OFFSETing a million rows, though.

2020-12-23 19:06:16	chris123123	but when you truncate the data is gone until you import the new ... I would use an additional column called "revision" and in all selects use the highest revision. Then you insert the new data into the table with a higher revision and are available all the time

2020-12-23 19:08:58	wyoung	It did  in my tests, I started loading data into it (which takes about 10 minutes to run) and while it was running I couldn't select from the table.
2020-12-23 19:09:21	basenode	what's a good table name for time series data?

2020-12-23 19:10:13	chris123123	wyoung, because your architecture is faulty. When you use the revisions the old revision is available until your update with the new revision is committed.

2020-12-23 19:17:01	chris123123	wyoung, there is a moment when you switch and a short down-time; depending on how the other applications are made that use this data, you interrupt them.
2020-12-23 19:17:26	Sliss	how do I replace in pg13 the last element of an array withour knowing the content?
2020-12-23 19:18:02	wyoung	chris123123: Really? even when I use a transaction?

2020-12-23 19:19:10	Sliss	all the array function examples use a value to replace hence my question
2020-12-23 19:19:22	chris123123	wyoung, of course, you don't know how they use the data. Most likely they don't have a single transaction open all the time. Suddenly you switch and they use row A from another revision and row B after your update

2020-12-23 19:19:56	avemestr	One workaround could be to introduce a view.
2020-12-23 19:20:08	chris123123	wyoung, next is: even if they do that. Do you want their transactions block your update as long as they like?
2020-12-23 19:21:27	avemestr	The view is a simple "SELECT xx FROM table1". Then when you need to refresh data, you fill up the data in table2. You don't touch table1 at all. All  you do is update the view to "SELECT xx from table2". The next day you truncate table1, and fill that with fresh data, and update the view back to "select xx from table1" when it's done.
2020-12-23 19:22:11	avemestr	And what the users are doing is then "SELECT xx from [view]".
2020-12-23 19:22:54	chris123123	avemestr, in his case this is probably even better because I think the data is never changed between the update-runs

2020-12-23 19:24:25	wyoung	chris123123: That's OK, the table is only queried, it is only written to when I want to update it and replace the contents.  It doesn't matter if one user gets the old data as the changes are using amendments, just the ordering isn't guarrenteed.
2020-12-23 19:25:30	wyoung	amendments, I mean the changes to data are usually additions / appending to the data, the problem is the sort order isn't known.
2020-12-23 19:26:07	wyoung	so I can't just appending only new data to the database as it may already exist, there could be a deletion but usually this won' occur.
2020-12-23 19:26:23	chris123123	that is what "UPDATE" is for ;)
2020-12-23 19:26:53	wyoung	There will be new data too

2020-12-23 21:40:32	erichanson	Bleh, this is going to be kinda hacky though.  Both formats are kind of black boxes without writing a parser and ideally I could use the same function that libpq does so the logic is identical.

2020-12-24 11:27:03	Synnx	anyone able to help write me a postgresql update query. I have 4 entries in a table
2020-12-24 11:27:33	Synnx	with "hours" property its json b format. I need to change it to a different set of values, willing to pay for any completed work. cheers
2020-12-24 11:28:07	peerce	UPDATE tablename SET fieldname=newvalue WHERE ....;    ?
2020-12-24 11:28:10	peerce	whats so hard?
2020-12-24 11:28:49	peerce	4 entries, meaning 4 fields in each row?  or just 4 rows?
2020-12-24 11:28:58	Synnx	unfamilar with syntax, existing data is this format:
2020-12-24 11:29:46	Synnx	"[[""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""], [""7:00"", ""23:30""]]"
2020-12-24 11:30:28	peerce	so its a json array of 2-element json arrays, all stored in a single field of a row of a table ?  ugh.
2020-12-24 11:30:43	Synnx	thats the jsonb i'm referring too, unsure how to update that. 4 entries, each with a "hours" field
2020-12-24 11:30:55	peerce	i don't see any field names
2020-12-24 11:31:12	peerce	json is normally {'key'=value]
2020-12-24 11:31:16	ilmari	what part exactly do you want to update, and how?
2020-12-24 11:31:29	Synnx	thats the raw jsonb data, doesnt need any field names, each object between [] is day of week
2020-12-24 11:31:43	ilmari	those are arrays, not objects
2020-12-24 11:31:52	ilmari	words. they mean things.
2020-12-24 11:32:09	Synnx	true, i used wrong word
2020-12-24 11:32:26	ilmari	so, what part do you want to update, and how?
2020-12-24 11:32:57	Synnx	just want to update the entire field itself, through a query to some data of exact same format, just different times values

2020-12-24 11:34:30	peerce	does this table have a primary key ?
2020-12-24 11:34:39	Synnx	yeah it does
2020-12-24 11:34:40	peerce	[hint, ALL tables *should* hav ea primary key]
2020-12-24 11:35:06	peerce	then, UPDATE tablename SET jsonfieldname=$1 WHERE primarykey=$2
2020-12-24 11:35:14	peerce	where $1 and $2 are values passed in as query parameters
2020-12-24 11:35:28	peerce	$1 bein gthe new json values, and $2 being the primary key of the row you want to change
2020-12-24 11:36:03	peerce	now, depending on your language binding, the notation for parameters might not be $1, $2, it could be ?, ?, or it could be something entirely different.

2020-12-24 11:37:41	jaziz1	looking to start a sports stat site with accounts and stuff, but have never made a sql db before
2020-12-24 11:37:45	Synnx	i think its using the jsonb_set is my concern, hard oto understand the syntax
2020-12-24 11:37:59	jaziz1	realistically speaking how much effort do I need to put into learning this stuff for a passable backend
2020-12-24 11:38:22	peerce	jaziz1; do you know any programming languages suitable for web developement ?
2020-12-24 11:38:26	jaziz1	yea
2020-12-24 11:38:38	peerce	before you knew any, how much effort wouyld it have taken to do this?
2020-12-24 11:38:52	jaziz1	uh
2020-12-24 11:38:52	jaziz1	quite a lot
2020-12-24 11:39:15	jaziz1	prob an impossible amount for my time frame haha
2020-12-24 11:39:19	peerce	SQL is another sort of programming language, and quite different, as its a declarative data manipulation language.

2020-12-24 11:40:40	jaziz1	used the language for sure

2020-12-24 19:03:18	Nekomander	jaziz, is SQL really that big of a deal though? What I am saying is, writing queries for your app is no big deal, and then you can apply changes to your table when it is necessary.
2020-12-24 19:03:47	dob1	Myon, no my concern is not this, I am aware of this. I would like to have a field that get incremeneted by one to every insert and keep this consistent without going from 10 to 100 to the next step
2020-12-24 19:04:05	Myon	then you need a table to track it
2020-12-24 19:04:19	Nekomander	Tables don't change much, if you did it right from the start. (As far as getting to know your data and understanding how it is being used. Then using this understand to build the table correctly to fit the purpose.)
2020-12-24 19:04:22	Myon	(and all operations will serialize on updating that field, yay performance)
2020-12-24 19:04:45	Nekomander	Sometimes, data isn't relational, and you might need another DB software to use along side PostgreSQL.

2020-12-24 19:05:24	Nekomander	Okay, then take some time with your tables.

2020-12-24 19:58:11	Nekomander	jaziz, might wanna look at BCNF. Ensuring the table (with at least 2 keys) serves a purpose, BUT another column on that table doesn't ALSO determine the aforementioned purpose.

2020-12-24 20:03:42	Nekomander	Frankly, when I design tables, I don't ever think much about NF* and so on. It just comes natural to me. Each table serves 1 purpose. If there is a column that stores a STRING and can then be used to uniquely identify a relationship to an entity (Name of a sports team), that should be in it's own table. For example, That column that uniquely identifies an Entity called "Sports team name" should be in its own table.

You decide on ONE thing: Is it possible for a person to be in MORE THAN ONE sports team? - If it is possible to be a member of more than 1 Sports team, then you can no longer store sports team info into the Person Table. Then you make a separate table which Describes a LIST OF TEAMS a Person is in.

2020-12-25 04:17:08	RhodiumToad	doing it without LIMIT, or with the ORDER BY nobbled to force a sort, should get you reasonably consistent performance across all cases, and there's scope for some speedup over what you have here
2020-12-25 04:17:48	Slade	3 different ways to do permissions, with different subtleties about them.. i wonder whats ideal.. first one obviously most space efficient https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/c237WPUGjy97n8owfZM9uE/0
2020-12-25 04:19:12	old_relik	one thing I tried was to the "minus" or the subtraction of all patients from the group minus this facility in application code

2020-12-25 04:20:01	RhodiumToad	do you actually need this LIMIT, btw?
2020-12-25 04:20:04	old_relik	yeah

2020-12-25 04:20:52	old_relik	I tried in application code because that way I didn't have to do the subselect at all, I just get the exact patient ids
2020-12-25 04:21:05	old_relik	and match it with bp.patient_id
2020-12-25 04:21:52	old_relik	which is only truly more efficient up to a point

2020-12-25 04:22:44	RhodiumToad	you can get the patient ids just as easily in sql, no need for application code
2020-12-25 04:23:10	RhodiumToad	that's essentially what you did by using any(array(...))
2020-12-25 04:23:30	old_relik	yeah
2020-12-25 04:23:41	old_relik	any(array()) is _good enough_
2020-12-25 04:23:52	old_relik	but for the super cheap case of 30k patients
2020-12-25 04:23:58	old_relik	it actually increase the overall duration
2020-12-25 04:24:01	RhodiumToad	one trick is to use  ORDER BY updated_at + interval '0' LIMIT 1000
2020-12-25 04:24:03	old_relik	from like 40ms to 180ms
2020-12-25 04:24:08	old_relik	oh what
2020-12-25 04:24:09	old_relik	let me try
2020-12-25 04:24:16	RhodiumToad	which gives you the same order and limit, but prevents using the index for ordering
2020-12-25 04:24:40	old_relik	but would it use the index for fetching but not sorting?
2020-12-25 04:24:47	RhodiumToad	almost any solution to this will tend to make that fast case slower
2020-12-25 04:24:56	RhodiumToad	it'll use a different index most likely
2020-12-25 04:25:12	incognito	old_relik: the index i mentionned above in one of the query was reindexed sooner
2020-12-25 04:25:15	RhodiumToad	plan will be the same as for the non-LIMIT case, except with a LIMIT on top
2020-12-25 04:25:21	incognito	is up to date

2020-12-25 08:53:49	bmomjian	because it isn't a huge file and it is going to add complexity. If you were going through all of ecpg, it would make sense, but not for a single function.
2020-12-25 08:56:22	RhodiumToad	what I'd like to see is a hex_encode and hex_decode in common/ that didn't make assumptions about how the caller wanted to handle errors. then the error handling could be done in the callers
2020-12-25 08:56:56	RhodiumToad	since it looks like there will be 3 callers with 3 different error handling requirements

2020-12-25 08:58:54	RhodiumToad	(ecpg's handling of hex decode errors there looks a bit dubious, but since it should only be decoding strings sent from the backend, that should not be an issue)
2020-12-25 08:59:21	RhodiumToad	(though, see recent discussions about the security issues of connecting to a malicious server)
2020-12-25 09:05:40	bmomjian	Yeah, I am adding a tool that will call hex_decode later today.

2020-12-25 13:38:44	jaziz	maybe I should also relearn ER diagrams
2020-12-25 13:39:14	peerce	'see your table visualized'?    I dunno, I look at a set of CREATE TABLE stratments, I have no problems understanding out it all fits.    wasting whitespace with boxes and lines isn't very productive.
2020-12-25 13:39:16	incognito	it's the bottom most layer before issueing sql orders
2020-12-25 13:39:39	peerce	most SQL is the queries that fetches and manipulates the data, rather than the DDL that defines the table structures
2020-12-25 13:39:44	jaziz	peerce, yea but I'm also not nearly as experienced as you
2020-12-25 13:40:12	peerce	so when you write code, do you flow chart it?  that was quite in fashion back in the 1970s
2020-12-25 13:40:37	jaziz	no, but if I were working with a tree I'd draw it out
2020-12-25 13:41:04	jaziz	sometimes it benefits to visualize
2020-12-25 13:41:20	peerce	ERD diagrams are ok for very simple stuff, but as soon as you get to a moderate level of complexity in your relations, they become a mess of spagetti

2020-12-25 13:42:11	peerce	i don't find that very helpful
2020-12-25 13:42:11	jaziz	yea that's hideous
2020-12-25 13:42:19	jaziz	project I have in mind isn't all that complicated though
2020-12-25 13:42:22	peerce	well, thats a classic ERD, or Entity-Relation Diagram
2020-12-25 13:42:41	jaziz	just users, accounts, some data for each account, sports stats
2020-12-25 13:43:21	peerce	or https://alabra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ER-diagram.gif
2020-12-25 13:43:56	jaziz	then again as messy as those look, I'm sure they mean something to the ones that use them

2020-12-26 08:57:13	stavros	This is for a home NAS DB, so I don't really need parallel stuff, I'd just like something that later allows me to maybe select a database to restore, for example
2020-12-26 08:57:39	RhodiumToad	well, in that case you're probably better off dumping each db separately
2020-12-26 08:58:04	RhodiumToad	pg_dumpall -g  dumps global stuff (user and role info, etc., that's not specific to any single db)

2020-12-26 09:13:03	Slade	never used a postgresql enum. lemme look it up
2020-12-26 09:14:23	Slade	ah custom type.. is there a challenge of changing an enum thats in use to add or remove values?
2020-12-26 09:15:02	 *	Slade has recently been bit trying to alter views
2020-12-26 09:15:03	ruurd	RhodiumToad does it mention the count of the tail 10%
2020-12-26 09:15:40	xocolatl	Slade: you can add but not remove values in an enum
2020-12-26 09:16:01	RhodiumToad	that query will return a row with a null value and a count which is the count of all the otherwise excluded rows
2020-12-26 09:16:13	Slade	xocolatl, even if its being used?
2020-12-26 09:16:35	xocolatl	yes
2020-12-26 09:16:38	Slade	ALTER TYPE name RENAME VALUE existing_enum_value TO new_enum_value
2020-12-26 09:16:38	Slade	   <-- can obsolete with a rename i guess
2020-12-26 09:16:40	RhodiumToad	basically, case when frac >= 0.1 then val end   is equal to val for the rows that represent the top 90%, and null for the rest

2020-12-26 11:09:06	xocolatl	anything under 16384 is stable, anything above is not
2020-12-26 11:11:11	zeks	sp basically I can count on all the basic types staying the same id, good
2020-12-26 11:11:42	xocolatl	all types that don't come from the user or an extension, yes
2020-12-26 11:12:11	xocolatl	so hstore is volatile, but bigint is not

2020-12-26 11:15:54	zeks	I can't find it in pg_types
2020-12-26 11:16:09	zeks	is it an alias to something?
2020-12-26 11:16:45	xocolatl	yes, its real name is int8
2020-12-26 11:17:16	zeks	is there a list of these aliases?
2020-12-26 11:17:33	zeks	I need to match oids to actual types
2020-12-26 11:17:39	xocolatl	probably, but I don't know where
2020-12-26 11:17:46	xocolatl	what are you doing?
2020-12-26 11:18:09	zeks	I am implementing a wrapper over libpqxx for my application and column_type() returns an oid

2020-12-26 20:22:07	bboy	Hi guys I'm trying to create database architecture for website page visitors. I have now one table which save the no of visitors, last visit, and page number. Everytime the user visited a page the no of visitors will increase by one. But the issue here I want to get the visitors per a month and per 3 month and per year. So I'm just trying to know what is the best way to make database arch for this.
2020-12-26 20:35:39	rk4	and how many visitors a month are you planning to accommodate for
2020-12-26 20:36:23	bboy	all visitors
2020-12-26 20:38:45	wlata	but what's the average number?
2020-12-26 20:38:46	albertlast	normaly you would save every action
2020-12-26 20:38:54	albertlast	and than calc on this  all the stuff

2020-12-26 20:40:50	albertlast	when you save every action
2020-12-26 20:41:00	albertlast	than everything else can be done based on this
2020-12-26 20:41:06	bboy	It's when the page is loading
2020-12-26 20:41:45	albertlast	yea make a new entry(insert) when he/she/it do something
2020-12-26 20:42:35	bboy	Yes. I'm actually using a CMS system. I have done this and it's working fine
2020-12-26 20:43:25	albertlast	from what you drescripte, it doesn'T work fine
2020-12-26 20:43:36	albertlast	you need the data in a scale which you don't have
2020-12-26 20:44:21	bboy	Yes. What I mean is that I'm able to get the visitors numbers.

2020-12-26 20:46:18	wlata	so, I would say, if your database can handle the traffic you optimally save the records in form (someuserid, action, timestamp). then you get into such aggregations, because you have all information in that.
2020-12-26 20:47:23	bboy	Yes albertlast. Correct me if I'm wrong. You mean that when ever the user visit the page. I should trigger a calc method so it immediately save the result. right?

2020-12-26 20:47:57	albertlast	like wlata say

2020-12-27 09:27:00	buu	So it seems like in the naive implementation there's a race condition where process A selects a row (name: test) and checks if it doesn't exist, it doesn't, then tries to insert it at the saem time process B selects a row (name: test) and sees it doesn't exist

2020-12-30 19:51:04	mbalmer	Why don't you consider something like ZeroMQ?
2020-12-30 19:53:09	scootd	cause there is another angle to these, there is a schedule-based override to these statuses that in based on time ranges and rules, so being able to include that in the determining query for a client status all in one place is much much simpler.
2020-12-30 19:53:45	scootd	having all of this in postgres, as opposed to in multiple places.
2020-12-30 19:55:08	scootd	also using something like zeromq or kafka wouldn't allow detection of expired statuses (when the ttl is over).
2020-12-30 19:55:32	scootd	those are mostly reactionary to events coming in.
2020-12-30 19:57:05	scootd	having it all in postgres, it just a single range query over the statuses ttl and all the schedule-based rules, etc.

2020-12-30 19:59:52	scootd	the only other options i can think of would be to use something like Elixir to manage this statuses, and then have that write to postgres when they either change or expire (so no ttl in postgres). but this is prone to issues obviously, if one of the elixir processes dies it will cause indefinitely incorrect statuses.

2020-12-31 09:29:30	avemestr	FreeBDSM: Have a look at boot_val and reset_val.
