2020-12-22 23:09:57	Ytui	Hello i have two tables, one has 100 columns, two 40 columns(MS SQL). I would like to select(with left join) all columns, all rows(its is simply, i know)
2020-12-22 23:09:57	Ytui	do that in one select? it is possible?

2020-12-22 23:21:47	Ytui	Xgc: Num column. It's is not foreign key, tables don't have foreign keys at all, but join is possible using num column

2020-12-22 23:27:28	Xgc	Joins without the necessary indexes can behave badly.
2020-12-22 23:27:54	Xgc	Also, you might not get all the data you wanted with just a left join.  Hard to tell without detail.

2020-12-22 23:37:03	Ytui	so what detail do you need?

2020-12-22 23:41:45	Xgc	Ytui: The specific kind of relationship will determine the answer.  A left join alone might not be sufficient.
2020-12-22 23:43:22	Xgc	Ytui: If you're not sure, just explain what the rows in each table represent.  Maybe I can guess from that detail.

2020-12-22 23:47:56	Xgc	The fact that you're asking the question makes the prior fundamental mistake much more likely.
