2020-12-19 12:14:14	another	git is build to handle mainly text files
2020-12-19 12:14:22	another	storing only diffs

2020-12-19 12:15:13	another	it doesn't?
2020-12-19 12:15:21	nedbat	it stores the whole file each time it's changed.
2020-12-19 12:15:42	nedbat	so if you make small changes to large files, it can take more space than you expect.
2020-12-19 12:16:06	nedbat	it compresses the file, but binary files often don't compress well, so that will magnify the effect.

2020-12-20 04:49:02	j416	I didn't read everything word for word, just spotted "isnâ€™t this the same as storing deltas? Itâ€™s not"

2020-12-21 03:51:06	cbreak	if you just resolve merge conflicts, then there are no new changes
2020-12-21 03:51:13	ikke	sure, but the result of a merge conflict is kind of by definition an evil merge
2020-12-21 03:51:29	imMute	yeah.  conflicts aren't always "no new changes"
2020-12-21 03:51:54	imMute	hell even a non-conflicted merge can still be functionally different than either source branch (ie, have bugs that neither branch did)
2020-12-21 03:52:16	ikke	right, which is why you also run CI on the branch
2020-12-21 03:52:27	imMute	that's why do you do CI on the *result* of the merge.
2020-12-21 03:53:35	imMute	for example, you can setup ADO so that when a PR is started, it will *do the merge* in the background and if it doesn't have conflicts it'll feed that commit into the build/test system.  you can take it a step further and tell it that if those builds/tests fail, the PR cannot be completed.
2020-12-21 03:53:52	cbreak	the only way you can prevent that is by only allowing FF merges
2020-12-21 03:54:10	cbreak	every other merge creates a new commit with potentially never-seen-before tree
2020-12-21 03:54:18	imMute	cbreak: not true - the process I just described can prevent them too.

2020-12-21 03:54:55	imMute	both cases solve the problem by running CI on the result of combining all the code.  either by forcing a linear history in your case, or by doing the CI on the result of the merge in mine.
2020-12-21 03:54:58	cbreak	well, that process performs an FF only merge into the target branch, after CI stuff
2020-12-21 03:55:07	cbreak	after creating the merge, and testing it
2020-12-21 03:55:24	cbreak	or at least after running the tests on it

2020-12-21 13:10:06	blue_penquin	You want to add the original repo as another remote, pull from it and merge it to your main branch of fork push to your fork to keep it synced with upstream.

2020-12-21 13:22:58	daysun	why push the main updates to the fork though?
2020-12-21 13:23:36	daysun	you only need the main locally to merge your branch with
2020-12-21 13:23:40	imMute	daysun: because the maintainers of the original repo probably don't want to give you push access to their repo.

2020-12-21 13:24:47	daysun	I mean, the pushed pull-request-branch will be up to date with main since I have pulled the main locally on my machine and merged it into my request-branch
2020-12-21 13:25:02	daysun	I then push my request branch
2020-12-21 13:25:22	blue_penquin	Yea you don't have to do the last push.  It's to keep the remote main synced with local main.
2020-12-21 13:26:01	daysun	by remote main you mean the original main (as in not my forked main)?
2020-12-21 13:26:21	imMute	did you really call your remote "main" instead of the default "origin" ??
2020-12-21 13:27:16	daysun	not me
2020-12-21 13:29:17	daysun	point is, as things are now, I'm just keeping my main on my computer synced with the upstream repo, while only pushing branches to my fork repo. I never update the main branch on my github fork. Do I need to?
2020-12-21 13:29:56	daysun	it's a "git pull && git push" with my current configuration to keep the fork main up to date. But I don't see any reason to do that since I never pull from the fork main ever anyway.
2020-12-21 13:31:03	blue_penquin	I'm saying it as a branch. Origin etc. are local aliases.
2020-12-21 13:32:29	hendry	I simply what vimdiff the same file in another branch, how I perform that?

2020-12-22 06:22:17	andytoshi	j416: there are a few parts of the documentation which contrast fossil to git, in particular around (a) fossil does a lot more than just source control, (b) fossil developers have a very strong anti-rebasing philosophy
2020-12-22 06:22:21	j416	quite a few times it seems
2020-12-22 06:22:32	andytoshi	and yeah, those two sections are linked in a ton of other places :P
2020-12-22 06:22:44	j416	andytoshi: interesting. perhaps I should try out fossil some time. thanks.

2020-12-23 16:50:29	osse	the best way to avoid that prompt is to run that command as suggested. You can also do the same thing that command does by using the -u flag when pushing. Both of thos ways only needs to be run once
2020-12-23 16:51:44	osse	hendry:  you can try  git config merge.defaultToUpstream true and see if that helps
2020-12-23 16:52:16	osse	never mind, I know it won't because it doesn't know what the upstream is

2020-12-23 19:29:07	andi_	and we do this (because we cannot change branches due to clearcase reasons) with git merge remote/origin/master
2020-12-23 19:29:25	andi_	and then just keep the changes we want/need
2020-12-23 19:29:52	andi_	it's sad but well that's the way it is right now. you guys do software too so you probably also know this kind of pain

2020-12-24 19:54:31	bryanpedini	How can I check if really said file was commited or not, and in case it wasn't, how can I commit it?

2020-12-26 06:23:13	energizer	but, i think it actually does store diffs, in packfiles, right?
2020-12-26 06:23:55	osse	it uses some sort of delta compression when creating the packfiles, yes.
2020-12-26 06:24:09	osse	But I don't think it's a diff in the patch sense

2020-12-26 06:53:21	Seveas	sure, why not. But you'll need to patch git to use it :)
2020-12-26 06:54:17	Seveas	energizer: a tag object contains the hash oof the object (usually commit) it points to. So the sha of the tag does take this commit into account.
2020-12-26 06:54:30	osse	energizer:  I mean that it's more like a general purpose compression (it can "diff" any version of any file with any other, not just one file against the prior version of itself)

2020-12-26 20:14:43	CoolerX	so I forked the repo on Github and cloned it

2020-12-26 20:16:49	CoolerX	I think this is similar to the situation beginners get into where they have a local repo with some code and on Github they make a repo adding a README and License
2020-12-26 20:16:57	CoolerX	then they are not able to push
2020-12-26 20:17:10	CoolerX	I think the solution in that case is to just push --force
2020-12-26 20:17:19	CoolerX	but in this case I am pulling
2020-12-26 20:17:42	CoolerX	maybe I should git remote add original ../path/to/original/repo

2020-12-30 20:06:19	chewb	can i have a question. I have problem where i made pull request with code that does work, but on PR side code does not work
2020-12-30 20:07:08	chewb	so: i have task branch and dev branch, dev branch is main branch
2020-12-30 20:07:25	-->	gonzo (~gonzo@ip-213-49-177-184.dsl.scarlet.be) has joined #git
2020-12-30 20:08:54	chewb	error was because of mixing junit4 with junit5, i used @Before annotation on some method, it did not worked on PR side because it lacked Junit4 imports like import Test and import Assert, after adding those imports method got called with @Before, without those imports method got called only with @BeforeEach otherwise error
2020-12-30 20:09:55	chewb	So i go to problematic file in intelij, go to Show git history. Last commit is: file without junit4 imports and with @BeforeEach
2020-12-30 20:10:31	chewb	but one commit before which is "merge dev into task branch" is FILE WITH JUNIT4 and WITH @Before
2020-12-30 20:10:48	chewb	i checked it again, code in this file works

2020-12-30 20:12:29	chewb	it was yesterday, i made PR with code that works (file with junit4 imports and @Before), but today i got information that code does not works, and need to replace one line @Before with @BeforeEach (it means there was no needed imports at the top)
2020-12-30 20:13:15	chewb	my question is: is it possible some other developer rewrote this file by accident in some merge, and deleted needed imports from top of file without my knowledge?
2020-12-30 20:13:44	chewb	can i change it in some way?
2020-12-30 20:15:00	chewb	also another detail, task branch i worked on yesterday is not the only one, i worked on this before using lets say branch taskY

2020-12-31 09:40:40	perrier-jouet	nasamuffin: my repo is in /home/perrierjouet and I want to track this folder /www/org-mode/ how can I do ? change the working tree just for this action ?
2020-12-31 09:41:13	nasamuffin	perrier-jouet: you should be able to just add the created link, it sounds like you have /home/perrierjouet/org -> /www/org-mode/; you can just 'git add org', probably
2020-12-31 09:41:36	nasamuffin	ah, but i guess it will track the link but not its contents
