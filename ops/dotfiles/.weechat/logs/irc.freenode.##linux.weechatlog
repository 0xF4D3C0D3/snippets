2020-12-19 09:09:16	tobiasBora	Hum... Any idea why on podman fuse does not work? I search on google (at least I tried), and the only advice I see is "use --device /dev/fuse and make sure your kernel is recent". Which is my case. Here is my full doce if it helps http://paste.debian.net/1177543

Without a pseudoterminal stdin, stdout and stderr are connected via pipes instead of a pts, try ssh user@remote and then (on the remote machine) ls -l /proc/$$/fd/   and  tty. Then do the same with the -T option to see the difference.

You could even boot an entirely diferent stable kernel...like let's say an Ubuntu 18.04

2020-12-19 11:41:30	ALowther	cyber: I'll check, but that seems like a non-standard package. I don't have internet access, as my kernel is panicking while attempting to connect, so I can only work with what I have.
2020-12-19 11:43:21	sunny94	Is it becasue emitting color needs extra computation so if standard ouput isn't connected to a terminal, we don't need that and can save some computations?
2020-12-19 11:43:41	cyber	ALowther: I've never had this issue. I'm merely looking online for ways to save data after a kernel panic. :(  if you are able to create the crash, this is (in a way) good since you might be able to set an environment to save the data just before. I've read that some will create a swap, transfer the kernel panic info to memory (using a software) and save it to hhd. But the log could be huge.

2020-12-20 21:09:40	fakuve	Hi , I was wondering if it is possible to sort your Downloads (browser and torrent ones) by filetype. I reckon by just assigning a cron task to recognise the file extensions and move them to (~/downloads to ~/videos/downloaded ~/images/downloaded/ )etc

(I was doing rsync -arnvuz --delete foldera/* folderb/ ) Cos If I do `rsync -arnvuz --delete foldera folderb` the contents of foldera will be dumped on a foldera subdirectory inside folderb (folderb/foldera )?

2020-12-21 00:35:54	akk	danisanti: I've set up a couple lists on freelists.org, they seem pretty good. Haven't used them heavily.
2020-12-21 00:35:55	kerframil	aLLamox: the issue is that the 'x' bit isn't set for the owner. that it is set for other users is immaterial.

2020-12-21 00:36:15	kerframil	you ran it as root so the owner bits apply.
2020-12-21 00:36:17	danisanti	akk: thank you
2020-12-21 00:36:19	aLLamox	So now it has read and excute ... both bash ping and ,/ ping gives permission denied

2020-12-21 00:36:46	aLLamox	kerframil: Could you please rephrase_
2020-12-21 00:36:48	aLLamox	?
2020-12-21 00:37:36	kerframil	aLLamox: you are presently executing the ping binary as root. the binary in question is owned by root. the binary in question has a mode that begins with "r-s" as far as the bits that pertain to the owner is concerned. "x" is not among them.
2020-12-21 00:37:37	aLLamox	https://imgur.com/oDRE1Hv.png I think both user and others have the x and r bit
2020-12-21 00:37:51	kerframil	hence, it is not executable by root.
2020-12-21 00:38:06	sunny9395	@Echoz, ah I get it. Thannnnk you!
2020-12-21 00:38:32	kerframil	the bits for others don't apply because you are not someone other than the owner right now.

2020-12-21 00:44:14	Echoz	aLLamox: so the reason this isn't working is because it's a script, so suid is ignored either way. You're gonna have to use sudo instead
2020-12-21 00:44:15	kerframil	aLLamox: yes. that should be the smallest change required to make it executable by a non-root user.
2020-12-21 00:44:45	Echoz	either that or write a program that does the same thing
2020-12-21 00:44:55	kerframil	Echoz is absolutely right. it it's a script, the setuid bit is usless anyway.

2020-12-21 00:48:27	kerframil	do you not have control over the sudoers configuration in this case?

2020-12-21 00:49:30	kerframil	that would be one solution, yes. you could define a policy for chage to run nmap, specifically, perhaps. note, however, that sudo will likely still object unless you fully qualify the path to nmap.
2020-12-21 00:50:07	Echoz	aLLamox: you give the users' group access to run that one specific command, or your specific script, rather than giving them full access to sudo like members of wheel or sudo often are

2020-12-21 01:16:24	kerframil	aLLamox: either write a policy for /usr/bin/nmap specifically, which seems to be what you are aiming for here, or call your script as: sudo /home/chage/.LeaderBoard/.ssh/ping, which should match the policy you just wrote.

2020-12-21 14:05:28	sauvin	If the area was as affluential as you claim, the high school probably had plenty of shekels to spare for roids.
2020-12-21 14:06:46	pnbeast	In the US, teachers are employed by the local football screening program.  Professors are employed by regional football training program, but they are told how to behave by people known as assistant coaches.  Other countries, I hear, are very different.

The former will not work if the same serial number is on both devices, but by-path should identify the USB port uniquely without the need for nvz to write their own rules

2020-12-22 12:48:25	c705	i either be sane and use ~/.profile, or continue to be pendetic and set alacritty to run a login shell
2020-12-22 12:48:35	c705	furthermore, use bash
2020-12-22 12:48:41	kurahaupo	Arguably the top level shell on a tty (or pty) should be a login shell, so it's weird that any terminal emulator doesn't do that by default
2020-12-22 12:48:44	c705	but i'm super edy and cool, so i'll keep doing what i do
2020-12-22 12:48:51	ayecee	i guess with tmux, you can't guarantee that a login shell has been run before tmux starts.

2020-12-22 15:33:29	gonutsfordonuts	hey guys...I have a crazy-town-bananas question. I've got a machine running an ubuntu-based linux image, and it uses the systemd-boot bootloader. On this machine, I have a separate drive with a windows install on it. It would be nice to...have a boot menu to pick which os I want to boot into. It would be the absolute bees knees if I could choose to boot into my windows OS from linux on the CLI.

When you order a pizza, you are dealing with a "layer of abstraction" as you don't need to worry about how the dough will be made, how the toppings will be applied, how long the pizza will be cooked for, etc. As a client, all you need to know when you want a pizza - is who to call up and how to ask.

2020-12-23 00:41:21	kerframil	akk: presumably, you will try to hand-wave away this other demonstration of a trailing slash influencing behaviour: touch f; touch notadir; cp -av f notadir/

2020-12-23 00:41:46	kerframil	right, sorry.
2020-12-23 00:42:11	mrig	hello :)
2020-12-23 00:42:12	akk	I agree that trailing slash behavior is super confusing. I've learned in rsync to always always include the trailing slash, because if I don't, it'll do something unexpected that isn't what I want.

2020-12-23 00:43:57	mrig	trailing slashes and relative paths, both good fun at times.

2020-12-23 14:36:47	kodah	when i worked for companies that used RHEL it was because they had people who didn't really know systems engineering and thus outsourced that job to RHEL support
2020-12-23 14:36:52	mlu	i.e. it's OK to have buggier / less stable software if you can push out fixes faster
2020-12-23 14:37:20	mlu	right, and in my experience, it's very hard to hire someone with that systems engineering experience

2020-12-23 15:03:09	jim	ok... when you get this thing, and if you're doing the install of the card yourself, be very careful when you insert the card into the slot, and make sure you mount it securely
2020-12-23 15:03:34	bradd_	I will. I'll get the card then. thanks for helping me out
2020-12-23 15:04:17	mlu	also, I hope you're paying <$100 USD for it :)
2020-12-23 15:04:28	jim	once the card is installed, lspci should show it

2020-12-23 15:07:00	pnbeast	bradd_, I admire the spirit, but you might want to check what you're going to pay in power bills to learn the routing.
2020-12-23 15:07:08	mlu	that said, did you know that you can get 4x10GbE cards for <$40 on eBay these days?

2020-12-25 01:09:11	akik	i've had multiple youtube videos where i have not been able to increase the volume with usual settings
2020-12-25 01:09:13	kerframil	I'm not disputing that it works. but you can't arbitrarily boost in software without running into potential issues of distortion, clipping and what have you. that's probably why the answer was rejected.
2020-12-25 01:09:24	kerframil	if it works out, then great.
2020-12-25 01:09:54	akk	When I used plain alsa, youtube volume was always way less than volume for anything else, I never figured out why.
2020-12-25 01:10:15	akk	With pulse, of course all apps have different volumes and you have to go chase that down, but at least I know where to look.

2020-12-25 10:42:56	Luther	there is a question I want to know: is container stable?  I want create containers by docker as VMs function in a physical server.
2020-12-25 10:42:56	Luther	how about the stability of container in provision environment?
2020-12-25 10:42:56	Luther	and if it is viable, how about the stability comparability of VM and container? which is more stable?

2020-12-25 13:44:23	stephenmac98	It would primarily be communicating with a UPS to monitor for power failure. Not every server on the network can communicate with it to shutdown automatically. I need a constantly running process that shuts down all the servers automatically when there is a power failure
2020-12-25 13:44:36	[R]	Khaytsus: he said shutdown, not flood
2020-12-25 13:44:38	stephenmac98	Not every server can communicate with the UPS
2020-12-25 13:44:56	stephenmac98	So this one computer needs to probably ssh into all the other computers and shut them down

2020-12-26 12:11:43	ayecee	it's using the same amount of power, and the power source is inside it
2020-12-26 12:11:53	neshpion	i guess that makes sense
2020-12-26 12:12:12	neshpion	my old phone would actually get warm on AC though
2020-12-26 12:12:19	neshpion	actually my previous laptop would as well
2020-12-26 12:12:32	ayecee	probably because it's charging at the same time, so using more power
2020-12-26 12:12:55	ayecee	or, the power settings are set such that it uses less power when on battery
2020-12-26 12:13:00	neshpion	oh no i remember what it is, i set my BIOS on-battery settings to favor a balance of performance and quiet, so it probably just doesn't spin the fans as much as it does on AC
2020-12-26 12:13:30	ayecee	and the reason it doesn't spin the fans as much is that it uses less power
2020-12-26 12:13:56	neshpion	but if it would just use the energy it's losing as heat it could be more efficient :^)
2020-12-26 12:13:57	ayecee	it's not that it just lets the system get hotter!

2020-12-26 20:14:41	triceratux	well i fixed my opengl issue with Open Virtual TraceRoute 1.7.1 on Lubuntu 20.04. before: https://i.imgur.com/EHk1GaU.jpg after: https://i.imgur.com/6NTvZru.jpg
2020-12-26 20:15:18	triceratux	turned out to be real simple. dont run openjdk 1.8.0. make sure you upgrade to openjdk 11. pffft everybody knows that :)

2020-12-26 20:53:10	domhnall	though if you factor anything coming over UDP vs TCP...then yeah it makes a bit small difference. not in choice though.

2020-12-27 09:15:30	TimMc	Significant whitespace makes refactoring more dangerous (especially combined with implicit scope) and really puts a damper on the use of closures and other functional programming techniques.

2020-12-30 21:37:17	NyB	Aminder45: Most databases will offer properties generally summarized with the initials ACID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). Filesystem APIs will generally don't provide all of those.

2020-12-31 09:22:24	r399	ive been stuck on this problem for a little while and cant figure this out. I wnat to create a seperate bridge for my network that will be used in virt-manager to provide a network interface for a virtual machine, and would like to be able to monitor the traffic on the virtual machine and be able to whitelist IP addresses that the virtual machine can access
2020-12-31 09:22:42	kulak	point here is simple: of all the people here in the chat who are developers and how many of you seriously contriube to open source?  I am one, but my contributions have been mostly along the lines: I use this open source project, crap it is buggy. Here is a fix for IoT issue I run into.  I have no time for anything else.  ultimately, my boss is paying me to get work done.  If no open source, boss
2020-12-31 09:22:44	r399	ive looked into brigdes, network namespaces, but i cant quite understand how to do this
2020-12-31 09:22:45	kulak	will pay for something or hire more devs to get it done within timeframe he needs.  That's what I see in real life.   most devs I know are DONE and don't want to see PC after work hours.  it is that simple.

2020-12-31 09:23:34	r399	R, but i need to partition my network out so that my host machine has full network access but the guest machine only has limited access
2020-12-31 09:23:44	r399	i dont want to block anything on the host machine, only the guest machine
2020-12-31 09:24:01	NyB	kulak: I have multiple colleagues who maintain open source projects. I have also occasionally contributed myself. Your experience may not be typical. Or mine might not be.

2020-12-31 09:25:15	shesek	kulak, I get paid to work on open-source, and still find myself spending more time doing unpaid work on personal open-source projects
2020-12-31 09:25:24	kulak	have you contributed on your personal time?  or is it on a company dime?
2020-12-31 09:25:29	r399	R, I understand I can block with iptables, but I dont understand how i block only connections on the virtual machine
2020-12-31 09:25:41	kurahaupo	kulak: I suspect that most people doing software development for fun probably have a day job as something other than "software developer", or at least in a completely different field.
2020-12-31 09:25:51	NyB	r399: if you have a bridge with the typical bridge-to-LAN setup, then the VM might as well be plugged onto your switch. It's all L2, IP is not even in the picture.
2020-12-31 09:25:59	kulak	see, I don't count company time as open source.  that's just part of business plan and businesss model.  there is no free lunch here.
2020-12-31 09:26:01	shesek	kulak, what is this "after work hours" thing you're talking about? I just program as long as I'm awake and don't have something better to do :)

2020-12-31 09:26:38	kulak	shesek: sounds like a loner to me.  I don't want to get personal, but work on personal time means no personal life.

2020-12-31 09:27:02	TJ-	r399: libvirt/virt-manager/virsh can be used to create a new bridge interface (although by default there should be a virbr0 already) then you'd be able to apply rules on virbr0
2020-12-31 09:27:31	r399	TJ-, really? didnt know this, this is helpful
2020-12-31 09:27:41	r399	so i simply apply iptables rules to virbr0?
2020-12-31 09:28:22	shesek	kulak, yeah, its does get mixed up. especially when you work from home like I do. but luckily I live with my SO and have a bunch of social activities related to my involvement in the local bitcoin community, so I manage to find some balance
2020-12-31 09:28:24	kulak	kurahaupo: I've been doing coding for 20+ years.  it is boring.  it might've been fun initially, then intesting to learn, then there is nothing really new and it is just flat boring now.
2020-12-31 09:28:32	NyB	r399: unless I'm mistaken, those rules won't have much of an effect if you also attach your external interface to virbr0
2020-12-31 09:28:39	Echoz	compiling gcc 10.2.0 took me 15 min, but it didn't seem to parallelize very well
2020-12-31 09:28:40	TJ-	r399: assuming libvirt has created that, yes. look at the existing rules; you should see a whole load of custom chains prefixed LIBVIRT_ ... "sudo iptables-save"

2020-12-31 09:32:03	NyB	ugh... I think I have to agree with an earlier discussion. ICMP needs a "fuck off" packet type. Appropriate for cases of "yes, scriptkiddie, congrats you found my SSH port, now please stop?"

2020-12-31 11:13:56	gebbione	yep and i was going to use -t to retain timestamps but not -a
2020-12-31 11:14:01	[R]	phogg: i just said 'so much time and so little to do' to one of them... im sure he didn't get the reference... but i didn't ask

2020-12-31 11:37:15	Dagmar	gebbione: Rsync has been around for a _long_ time.  Lots of admins have had time to cuss about it not doing this, that, or the other perfectly obvious thing, which is why -a now does literally _all_ the extra bits you might expect or need
2020-12-31 11:37:41	phogg	anarchocommunism: be glad you live in the modern world where most web browsers work about the same, incompatible CSS is rare, display: grid; exists, and you don't have a myriad of browser-specific layout hacks cluttering your brain. Enjoy.
2020-12-31 11:38:01	Dagmar	gebbione: You were going from NTFS to something else.  Permissions and ownership are going to be demolished anyway and will need to be reset, which is less hassle using chmod/chgrp than it is to even mess with -o/-g

2020-12-31 11:40:50	[R]	so you want to hash the entire thing every time?
2020-12-31 11:41:19	neshpion	hash the entire block device every time something on it changes

2020-12-31 11:41:26	koollman	[R]: rsync main point is the second time you run it, really. that's what make it different from cp. I would love something that is to dd what rsync is to cp or scp, if you prefer

2020-12-31 11:42:09	koollman	[R]: rsync doesn't hash entire things. it has pretty nice block-based streaming checksum
2020-12-31 11:42:21	neshpion	in fact Linux is a kernel whereas UNIX is an operating system.  the appropriate comparison to UNIX would be GNU, which by definition is not UNIX
2020-12-31 11:42:26	MrFlibble	when Linux finally becomes UNIX(tm) Linux will have arrived.
2020-12-31 11:42:26	Dagmar	koollman: yeah there's a degree to which that is bittorrent, although bittorrent has a *wildly* different use case

2020-12-31 11:42:44	koollman	but, it does not apply it to blocks. you can however use rsync on very large files, and it does work, and only sync the difference
2020-12-31 11:42:49	koollman	but ... not blocks :/
2020-12-31 11:42:50	MrFlibble	c705: a UNIX system

2020-12-31 11:43:03	Dagmar	koolman: Yeah, BT attacks the problem via blocks
2020-12-31 11:43:06	c705	it's a standardisation
2020-12-31 11:43:11	[R]	phogg: so you're saying there's a chance
2020-12-31 11:43:11	MrFlibble	[R]: I made a meme for that
2020-12-31 11:43:14	koollman	Dagmar: rsync knows about blocks, only into files :)
2020-12-31 11:43:22	Dagmar	I kinda wish rsync would get that as a feature but I'll be damned if I'll take hte bug reports from trying to code it
2020-12-31 11:43:39	koollman	like really, if you remove the file-type detection from rsync, it pretty much 'just works' on devices

2020-12-31 11:58:42	domhnall	phogg: well, I saw some familiar syntax in Bash and immediatly thought about JS
2020-12-31 11:58:54	phogg	domhnall: I have been doing JS for 22 years and shell for 21, I am fluent in both. I assure you they are starkly different.
2020-12-31 11:59:02	c705	and once you learn one, picking others up is somewhat trivial

2020-12-31 12:01:31	anarchocommunism	I think windows has NSA trojans in it
2020-12-31 12:01:32	neshpion	most of my day-to-day is pinned together with shoddy bash scripts
2020-12-31 12:01:48	neshpion	and even better than that, functions defined in my .bashrc
2020-12-31 12:01:49	phogg	domhnall: you can run shell scripts anywhere you have an interpreter, which is *probably* only on your local system.
2020-12-31 12:01:56	neshpion	which are even *more* hacked together
2020-12-31 12:02:01	jim	domhnall, bash is a command line interpreter, one of many different ones
2020-12-31 12:02:15	Dagmar	gebbione: Have you considered that perhaps those "files" are nasty NTFS-specific things like Windows perversion of symlinks that _won't_ transfer over properly in any case?
2020-12-31 12:02:18	domhnall	phogg: I see... and now that I think about it.. its pretty much about the shell then...yes?

2020-12-31 12:02:59	phogg	domhnall: bash, and POSIX shells in general, are for interactive use first, for scripting second. As such they make better command line environments than languages. This is intentional.
2020-12-31 12:03:01	anarchocommunism	the kernel has OOPS sometimes then my LAN adapter stops working

2020-12-31 12:03:10	Dagmar	gebbione: ...and just because it says something doesn't mean it's an "error".  Mainly it's just keeping you informed in case something might take you by surprise
2020-12-31 12:03:16	neshpion	domhnall: the shell can determine what kinds of expressions are meaningful, as well as what precisely they may mean.  that's why it's important to know, for portability, what "bashism" are

2020-12-31 12:03:32	phogg	domhnall: there's a lot you can do with them, some things which they're well suited to, but also many things which are difficult to the point of being unwise.
2020-12-31 12:03:33	gebbione	Dagmar, in my case most are php binaries installed by composer or node_modules files (probably executables too) on NTFS ... but i just wanted to get why they would not transfer. I guess the symlink hint you gave me is enough
2020-12-31 12:03:50	anarchocommunism	I created a bugzilla report on redhat.com
2020-12-31 12:03:58	anarchocommunism	maybe a redhat dev will fix it
2020-12-31 12:04:14	Dagmar	gebbione: A more, um... contemporary example would be it churlishly refusing to copy /dev files or things from /proc or /sys
2020-12-31 12:04:26	Dagmar	Like, nothing good will generally come from that either
2020-12-31 12:05:03	gebbione	in my case though these files in theory should be copied to keep the consistency of the status of those folders at the time they were saved
2020-12-31 12:05:18	anarchocommunism	what is a good price to charge a small business for a front end website?
2020-12-31 12:05:25	Echoz	my realtek interface was working well on 5.9
2020-12-31 12:05:30	gebbione	without those files the node modules or the phpexecutables would not exist and thus the folders and the applications would be different
2020-12-31 12:05:32	Dagmar	gebbione: And should it ever come up, you might remember this.  It barely does ACLs (which aren't the user:group things you might be thinking of) and fails horribly with SElinux contexts because of the way it tries to copy anything resembling filesystem "attributes"
2020-12-31 12:06:12	domhnall	anarchocommunism: if you're not that great with CSS... idk.
2020-12-31 12:06:18	anarchocommunism	I mean
2020-12-31 12:06:21	anarchocommunism	if I get good at css
2020-12-31 12:06:24	Dagmar	Mainly you might tell it to simply ignore selinux contexts entirely and relabel everything when you're done because when it tries to yank _all_ the contexts off a file only to put back the ones it thinks should be there, the kernel will give it the middle finger salute
2020-12-31 12:06:27	kerframil	gebbione: the problem is, copying "non-regular" files from an NTFS filesystem will likely accomplish no such thing
2020-12-31 12:06:28	phogg	domhnall: The way I like to think about it is this: In most languages *modules* must be written in the same language. You can't have a JS program import Python code (without embedding a python interpreter or transpiling it). But in shells, the only module system is "execute a process". This means that it's perfectly reasonable to write a "shell script" which is largely in C, or any other languages, so you can pick the right language for each sp

2020-12-31 12:07:16	gebbione	kerframil, wouldnt i achieve that consistency if i zipped the files and unzipped them on the other drive?
2020-12-31 12:07:16	kerframil	gebbione: take one of them, and investigate it with stat.
2020-12-31 12:07:22	phogg	domhnall: of course you can execute a program from another program in essentially all languages, but they don't use this as a natural way to extend functionality.
