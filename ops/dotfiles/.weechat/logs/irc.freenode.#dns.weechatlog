2020-12-22 09:52:23	pepperoni	what should resolv.conf settings be if the router is set to use dns servers in the openvpn config?
2020-12-22 09:52:45	pepperoni	would /etc/resolv.conf override the nameservers in the router if set?
2020-12-22 10:16:36	SpiritHorse	usually it's the other way around, openvpn would update resolv.conf with the DNS spec'd in the openvpn config
2020-12-22 10:16:45	SpiritHorse	and then replace it with orig on exit
2020-12-22 10:35:04	pepperoni	ok, thanks, then that's certianly not happening, apparently my host network config file is setting resolv.conf

2020-12-26 16:14:52	emilengler	Is the data transmitted over the DNS protocol always in 7-bit ASCII?
2020-12-26 16:15:32	Peng	Which data? No.
2020-12-26 16:17:45	emilengler	Peng: Just in general. Also I would consider Punycode as ASCII here. Just wanna be sure if storing protocol in an 8-bit signed char is ok
2020-12-26 16:17:53	emilengler	protocol data*
2020-12-26 16:20:39	Peng	"the data" is really vague. But, as I said, no.
2020-12-26 16:21:01	Peng	Most aspects of DNS is or can be non-ASCII on the wire.
2020-12-26 16:21:50	Peng	Labels are arbitrary binary data, but case insensitive in a way equivalent to ASCII.
