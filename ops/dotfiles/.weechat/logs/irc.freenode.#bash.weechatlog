My goal is to scan through them and make a cover.jpg symbolic link in the same directory that the original file is in. I know I could use find for that and tried something like find . -name 'folder.jpg' -type f -exec bash -c 'ln -s "$1" "${1/\/cover.jpg/}"' -- {} \; but it did not work. I don't really know regex, how can I get this command to do what I described?

2020-12-21 13:51:25	Shred00	anyone got any nifty examples of a script detecting it's not being run with bash and re-executing itself with bash?  i'm thinking along the lines:

2020-12-21 13:51:25	Shred00	    exec /bin/bash $0 "$*"

2020-12-21 13:52:18	llua	telling the user to use bash is a problem, why?
2020-12-21 13:52:30	Shred00	because it's not a user that is invoking the script
2020-12-21 13:52:52	llua	even less of a reason to need the test then
2020-12-21 13:53:11	llua	ensure the process that invokes it, use bash
2020-12-21 13:53:15	Shred00	you need the test to prevent recursively re-execing

2020-12-21 13:53:54	Shred00	that is not an option.  bash is optional on this system and so applications must never rely on it being present.
2020-12-21 13:54:08	MTecknology	that's what the shebang is for

I'm sure there's some type of overhead there that is not present in perl's simpler approach of just reading directly from a fh.

2020-12-22 09:19:27	 *	pj looks
2020-12-22 09:19:35	eschwartz	so add in some checks for "last read command returns 1"

2020-12-22 09:21:17	pj	I think you need -t1 or something, and you get a specific exit code if it times out.
2020-12-22 09:21:18	kerframil	MTecknology: put another way, if one can make the code faster, why not, but the returns diminish rather precipitously in the case of bash.
2020-12-22 09:21:39	eschwartz	mapfile is generally nicer than read, doesn't have the IFS issue, and reads the entire file at once... but, it doesn't return 1 if the ending delimiter is missing
2020-12-22 09:21:48	mknod	kerframil, Perl Programming 4e addresses 5.14, and the article speaks of :utf8 as a 5.6 remnant, weird
2020-12-22 09:22:11	kerframil	mknod: well, I hope it's in there somewhere. it should be.
2020-12-22 09:22:16	pj	also you can't control the delimiter with mapfile and it doesn't process individual fields on each line.
2020-12-22 09:22:33	eschwartz	I think it's been kind of hacked by printing an ending delimiter after your file, then checking the *size* of the last mapfile field

2020-12-22 10:56:04	eschwartz	but the only difference is inode...
2020-12-22 10:56:22	kerframil	yeah, pretty much.
2020-12-22 10:56:22	eschwartz	cat+rm, vs. mv
2020-12-22 10:56:38	ryzenda	bash question: `count=0;echo $(for n in {1..3};do ((count+=1));done) $count`     Is it possible to increment a variable inside a subcommand and reference the variable external just outside in the parent command?
2020-12-22 10:56:56	eschwartz	OTOH the mv is also resistant to being interrupted and leaving a half-written file, which is admittedly unlikely
2020-12-22 10:57:46	eschwartz	ryzenda: by definition no, due to subcommands
2020-12-22 10:57:47	kerframil	that tooo. mv is effectively just a rename if operating within the confines of the same filesystem.
2020-12-22 10:57:48	eschwartz	use IPC
2020-12-22 10:57:50	kerframil	too
2020-12-22 10:59:04	eschwartz	one valid implementation of IPC is count=0; newcount=$(for n in {1..3};do ((count+=1));done; echo "$newcount"); echo "$newcount"
2020-12-22 10:59:06	kerframil	MTecknology: basically, as above. for this scenario, the only drawback I can think of is that the mode would change. not sure it matters for sshd_config but it can dealt with as necessary.

2020-12-22 13:13:14	sybariten	So i made this little script...  https://pastebin.com/MTp4VLyt      It works fine for what it should do, _unless_ i give != 1 arguments cause the die function causes my ssh connection to the machine running the script, to disconnect.

2020-12-22 13:16:58	sybariten	kerframil: hm, what would be the difference there? if i use bash ?
2020-12-22 13:17:16	sybariten	ive never fully grasped this subshell structure
2020-12-22 13:17:32	kerframil	subshells have nothing to do with anything being discussed here.
2020-12-22 13:17:53	kerframil	if you execute "bash" from a shell, it is a subprocess of said shell, just like any other program you might run.
2020-12-22 13:18:01	eschwartz	wget URL/script.sh && (source script.sh)
2020-12-22 13:18:19	kerframil	if you source, the code is directly imported into - and execute within the context of - the current shell. you should only use source if that is deliberate.
2020-12-22 13:18:36	e36freak	eschwartz: brilliant
2020-12-22 13:18:40	sybariten	kerframil: i meand subprocesses
2020-12-22 13:19:01	e36freak	sybariten: source basically takes the commands and runs them as if you've typed them into the shell you're currently in
2020-12-22 13:19:22	e36freak	so if it says "exit", the shell you're in exits
2020-12-22 13:19:27	sybariten	e36freak: aaaaAAAAAaaa. That explains the exit
2020-12-22 13:20:02	sybariten	uhm, is it possible to say "when" people typically need to use source? Or is it too vast of a quesiton
2020-12-22 13:20:03	kerframil	so, your given reason for using source doesn't currently stand up very well.
2020-12-22 13:20:46	kerframil	sourcing library code, defining common functions, variables, aliases etc.
2020-12-22 13:21:10	kurahaupo	eschwartz: I meant the man page didn't mention "Match"
2020-12-22 13:21:52	kerframil	sybariten: look at your /etc/profile for instance. that would be useless if it were executed as a script.
2020-12-22 13:21:55	e36freak	sybariten: you would source .bashrc, for example, which defines functions and aliases and shit you want in the current shell

2020-12-22 13:23:05	sybariten	kerframil: right right, if im storing often used aliases and want them in my current session....
2020-12-22 13:23:28	kurahaupo	sybariten: the shortest adaptation would be « ( . script.sh ) » so that "exit" only terminates the subshell
2020-12-22 13:23:31	e36freak	or to set PS1, or change PATH, etc
2020-12-22 13:23:43	e36freak	kurahaupo: but why
2020-12-22 13:23:49	e36freak	bash script
2020-12-22 13:23:51	sybariten	but, what about eschwartz suggesion earlier with the && test ... that one uses source ?
2020-12-22 13:23:59	eschwartz	well, you can do `source script.sh --args` too, so it's *mostly* but not entirely like typing them in line by line
2020-12-22 13:23:59	kerframil	or to just use return instead of exit but it would stil be weird.
2020-12-22 13:24:17	e36freak	eschwartz: it was a simplification to aid understanding
2020-12-22 13:24:25	eschwartz	(I know)
2020-12-22 13:24:30	e36freak	uh huh
2020-12-22 13:24:43	sybariten	kurahaupo: hm, could you explain what you mean there?
2020-12-22 13:24:45	e36freak	sybariten: that was kinda silly and pointless, imo
2020-12-22 13:24:46	sybariten	didnt get it
2020-12-22 13:24:52	sybariten	e36freak: ok
2020-12-22 13:25:08	e36freak	"return" exits a sourced script without exiting the calling shell
2020-12-22 13:25:13	e36freak	like it does from a function
2020-12-22 13:25:20	e36freak	but... just don't use source and it's a non-issue
2020-12-22 13:25:24	eschwartz	it's kind of neat but mostly useless to use (source script.sh --args)
2020-12-22 13:25:39	sybariten	yeah i will use bash, or chmod
2020-12-22 13:25:41	eschwartz	it saves you execing bash again, still forks though
2020-12-22 13:26:01	kurahaupo	But if it's not a sourced file, it will complain, and may continue to execute lines after the return statement
2020-12-22 13:26:26	eschwartz	it's conceivably useful if you desperately need to run a script but your bash binary is broken, so you really want to use the current interpreter
2020-12-22 13:27:09	kurahaupo	sybariten: I missed that eschwartz had made the same recommendation, only using "source" instead of "."
2020-12-22 13:27:42	MTecknology	so, ehm... what's the script in question? If it's only a "library" then why is it triggering an exit in the first place?
2020-12-22 13:28:07	sybariten	kurahaupo: ah, the parenthesis does something .. ok
2020-12-22 13:28:17	eschwartz	MTecknology: it's a shell script that is being nevertheless sourced for unclear reasons
2020-12-22 13:28:24	sybariten	MTecknology: sets up a new user and downloads an ssh server
2020-12-22 13:28:28	kurahaupo	!subshell
2020-12-22 13:28:29	greybot	http://mywiki.wooledge.org/SubShell
2020-12-22 13:29:20	kurahaupo	If it's a script rather than a sourced module, why does it have a filename that ends with .sh ?
2020-12-22 13:29:27	kurahaupo	!.sh
2020-12-22 13:29:27	greybot	Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language. See http://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/documents/commandname-extensions-considered-harmful
2020-12-22 13:29:33	MTecknology	I was referring to this in particular-> 04:20 < kerframil> sourcing library code, defining common functions, variables, aliases etc.
2020-12-22 13:29:47	eschwartz	sybariten: the only difference between my suggestion of "source" and kurahaupo's later suggestion of "." is that "source" is a bash alternative spelling for "."
2020-12-22 13:29:48	kerframil	sybariten: given that it's such a trivial script, you could also elect to use a structured approach e.g. https://termbin.com/5qlxh
2020-12-22 13:31:51	eschwartz	kurahaupo was really correct to use "."
2020-12-22 13:32:15	kurahaupo	sybariten: you don't need "grep" with "ip"; just use "ip -4 -o addr list"
2020-12-22 13:32:44	kurahaupo	"-4" will limit the answers to inet results
2020-12-22 13:32:45	sybariten	kerframil: whats the advantage of using false to my exit?
2020-12-22 13:33:00	kerframil	it won't exit
2020-12-22 13:33:29	kerframil	however, the false ensures that the invocation of warn propagates an exit status value of > 0, indicating failure.
2020-12-22 13:33:41	sybariten	oh you mean like that. Well i dont need to run source really i guess, it was just something i did
2020-12-22 13:33:43	kerframil	(given that it will be the last command executed in the case of failure)
2020-12-22 13:33:53	sybariten	kurahaupo: thanks
2020-12-22 13:33:54	kerframil	but yeah, none of this looks like source material.
2020-12-22 13:34:48	MTecknology	Did I miss the link to source?
2020-12-22 13:35:15	sybariten	But is it an ugly stucture to have a test first and doing exit if that fails, and in all other cases forcing the rest of the script? In other words, is it better practice to have an actual if/else, like you do
2020-12-22 13:35:22	MTecknology	btw- https://script-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples/shell.html  <-- everything in that example isn't "source material"
2020-12-22 13:35:48	MTecknology	everything here, is -> https://script-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers/shell.html
2020-12-22 13:36:27	sybariten	kurahaupo: yeah the sh thing was probably also out of my ignorance, i thought it was okay to do that to make shell scripts stand out in file listings
2020-12-22 13:37:17	sybariten	another thing, as far as i can tell from the man page, there is no way through adduser to omit the phone and room number questions right?
2020-12-22 13:39:02	MTecknology	people still use adduser?
2020-12-22 13:39:19	MTecknology	(you probably want useradd)

2020-12-22 13:40:34	kerframil	sybariten: there was a discussion about this earlier. there are some what will insist that it is improper and I can't say that I fully agree. at the same time, it's possible for the pendulum to swing in the other direction and for the control flow of a program to be rendered incoherent by a lack of structure. there's a balance to be found, I think.

2020-12-22 16:49:50	Guest20	a basic question, when using pipes why is it essential to close the two file descriptors?

2020-12-22 16:50:17	Guest20	is it because when we dot use close()., the read end of the pipe still expects the input as it doesnt have the EOF?

2020-12-22 21:07:40	earnestly	tsunamie: You need to correctly quote variable expansions.  "" prevents wordsplitting while '' suppresses shell syntax evaluation.  You simply supplied the literal string '$backtothepast'
2020-12-22 21:07:42	pluberflas	I'm no expert, but the single quote usually causes the varabiable to become a literal $variable instead of the value it points to. Double quotes work better.
2020-12-22 21:08:06	earnestly	Also you may want to consider using jq to generate the json for you, using jq --arg date "$backtothepast" ...

2020-12-22 21:38:20	earnestly	tsunamie: Sure because the comparison doesn't succeed for any inputs, so you get nothing back

2020-12-22 21:39:34	earnestly	tsunamie: It's just a string, iso8601 was carefully designed so that you can compare them lexicographically without needing to convert them to seconds for numerical comparison
2020-12-22 21:40:16	earnestly	There's nothing "special" about the string anymore than how you can compare strings normally

If it is always zero regardless of success or failure, you'll need to implement your own logic to handle the failure scenario

2020-12-23 15:49:02	petrj	after some googling i found that this gives character code of variable stored in `$A` (128512):  `A="😀"; printf '%d\n' "'$A"`  but what is the meaning of single quote before $A?
2020-12-23 15:49:21	petrj	does it mean "tread value as single character"?
2020-12-23 15:50:48	e36freak	Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated  as  C constants,  except  that a leading plus or minus sign is al‐ lowed, and if the leading character is a  single  or  double quote, the value is the ASCII value of the following charac‐ ter.

2020-12-23 17:00:02	acresearch	people, i am stuck trying to perform an operation (divide a machine learning dataset into a train and valid segements)... i have a large .csv file with 26,533 rows (and 2 labels), i want to divide it into two files     A.csv=5,306 rows   and B.csv=the rest     what i did was "head -n 2653 > x" "tail -n 2563 > y" "cat x y > A.csv" this is the valid segment (ensuring equal number of both labels)
2020-12-23 17:00:05	acresearch	now my question is: how do i cut out the remaining middle section?    i hope my explanation was clear
2020-12-23 17:01:53	yitz	head -n 5306 file > a ; tail -n +5307 file > b
2020-12-23 17:02:38	acresearch	yitz: ah i see   let me think about it for a second
2020-12-23 17:02:43	yitz	That splits the file at row 5306
2020-12-23 17:02:54	yitz	I have no idea what labels or middle sections are
2020-12-23 17:03:15	acresearch	yitz: it would make sense if i drew it graphically, but i can't haha
2020-12-23 17:03:21	acresearch	bith labels are in the middle
2020-12-23 17:03:40	acresearch	and i want both of them in the B.csv
2020-12-23 17:03:51	yitz	bash doesn't have a concept of labels. How do you identify a "label" ?

2020-12-24 07:05:43	pyzozord	hello, this might be wrong channel but I'm running out of ideas. I am using gdb specifically the "list" command that prints out few lines of code. I want to enter few "list" commands and then be able to scroll back my terminal (actually tmux but I guess it doesn't matter) and see all those listed lines of code. However that doesn't happen. Instead as soon as I scroll up, I see previous bash commands, it
2020-12-24 07:05:49	pyzozord	seems that gdb is kind of redrawing itself from the same position always, so it doesn't write to the terminal buffer history. When I do "TERM=dumb gdb" it does exactly what I want! Except that now also the program I am debugging has no terminal features. Is there some kind of a way to disable just the scrollback/cleanup thing for a program?
2020-12-24 07:06:10	slacka	I think i might need to read the documentation for my scanner. I assumed that if i scan a barcode with a multiplier, it was submitting all of the data at once separated by newlines, but now i'm think it is acting like a pipe.

2020-12-25 07:17:41	slacka	Here's my predicament. My validation.txt file has lines terminated with \r\n.  I need to search to see if a string exactly matches a line. My search strings can possibly contain special characters used by regex, so i thought i'd use grep and avoid having to escape them all by using -F (fixed string). However, i need to append \r to my search string and that doesn't work if -F is involved. If i just use -x, then \r can be appended to my search string
2020-12-25 07:17:41	slacka	but then i'll have to escape all the potential chars that regex interprets.

2020-12-25 13:14:52	eschwartz	petrj: kerframil provided that, not me. But, the purpose of the null byte there is so that read can properly split on records, even if they contain newlines
2020-12-25 13:15:25	kerframil	which means you no longer have an excuse to avoid -r and can dispense with all of the utter madness that was the rest of it.
2020-12-25 13:16:23	eschwartz	since read -d '' splits lines on the null byte, every record gets eval'ed on its own and you don't descend into the pit of madness and despair that is thinking you'll be able to correctly interpret  string literal \n

2020-12-26 10:23:55	petrj	vs.
2020-12-26 10:23:59	e36freak	there isn't one

2020-12-26 10:24:09	e36freak	whatever's in $x would be the format specfier
2020-12-26 10:24:18	e36freak	which is exactly what you don't want to do
2020-12-26 10:24:32	mknod	$x is a format string here, which may or may not contain one or more format specifiers
2020-12-26 10:24:57	caterfxo	%s is for strings, %d is for digits...?
2020-12-26 10:25:17	e36freak	pretty much yeah
2020-12-26 10:25:18	petrj	shellcheck tells me to use format specifier "^-- SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string. Use printf '..%s..' "$foo"."
2020-12-26 10:25:20	mknod	caterfxo: and so on
2020-12-26 10:25:28	e36freak	shellcheck is correct

2020-12-26 10:27:52	mknod	e36freak, I would too
2020-12-26 10:27:54	e36freak	petrj: maybe figure out a more sane way to do what you're doing there
2020-12-26 10:28:05	caterfxo	petrj: why are you doing this?
2020-12-26 10:29:22	petrj	so there is no format specifier which matches the raw output? then i will suppress the shellcheck rule.
2020-12-26 10:29:51	caterfxo	are you asking me?
2020-12-26 10:30:51	caterfxo	clarify what you're trying to do, start with the simplest part first, test it as you go, and build it up piece by piece
2020-12-26 10:30:53	mknod	petrj, %s passes whatever you feed it with as-is, but what you are doing is most likely wrong here
2020-12-26 10:32:56	petrj	mknod: explain wrong?
2020-12-26 10:33:12	mknod	petrj, explain your code?
2020-12-26 10:33:13	petrj	command printf $x executes and prints stuff properly as needed
2020-12-26 10:33:16	petrj	`x='this is '"'"'test'"'"' \"$y1 --\"\n';    printf "$x"`
2020-12-26 10:33:25	petrj	if you missed it above
2020-12-26 10:33:55	mknod	so, where is the issue? also, perhaps you *think* it does.
2020-12-26 10:34:15	petrj	no issue, im saying shellcheck is complaining " ^-- SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string. Use printf '..%s..' "$foo"."
2020-12-26 10:34:33	petrj	so i wanted to make sure if this rule is correct in this case..

2020-12-26 10:41:33	petrj	mknod: makes sense. shellcheck is raising `SC2059` even with that example. wonder if suppressing this warning is the only way.. 🤔
2020-12-26 10:42:30	mknod	probably so
2020-12-26 10:42:37	mknod	# printf '%s <> %d <> %f\n' 0x2a 0x2a 0x2a # caterfxo

2020-12-26 10:44:16	caterfxo	*sigh*
2020-12-26 10:45:02	petrj	yup, wonder if it warrants a new specifier for 'raw mode' / 'as-is'.  hypothetical `printf "%r" "$x"` // tread the value as format specifier, to assert "i know what i am doing"
2020-12-26 10:45:21	mknod	caterfxo, here, 0x2a is just the hexadecimal notation of 42, which is natively interpreted as a number by Bash

2020-12-26 10:47:20	caterfxo	mknod: yes, although '0x' notation in an arithmetic context is assumed to be octal, no?

2020-12-26 17:37:42	petrj	when we store the output of printf that ended with linefeed, the linefeed character gets lost in the variable value. but if the linefeed was in the middle, that remains preserved. is there a way to preserve the trailing linefeed in the variable?

2020-12-27 09:13:24	caterfxo	ok. too much _and_ underengineered
2020-12-27 09:13:48	earnestly	caterfxo: Keep in mind that `man 1 man' and `man man.1' are equivalent
2020-12-27 09:14:30	earnestly	Yours doesn't account for sections like '1perl' or 'n' or '1p', etc.
2020-12-27 09:14:48	MTecknology	This almost reminds me of writing a script that turns a bash script into documentation. (granted, it's basically just stripping comments and dumping into a page, since the comments are rst-formatted.
2020-12-27 09:15:10	caterfxo	I, um, haven't ever actually used any of those sections
2020-12-27 09:15:19	caterfxo	good point, though
2020-12-27 09:15:49	earnestly	All you have to do is change \([^ ]\{1,\}\)(\(.*\)) => \1.\2

2020-12-27 09:16:45	caterfxo	yes, I see that now. this was the 'outside of the obvious' part
2020-12-27 09:16:49	earnestly	caterfxo: Also think more like plumber.  Instead of wrapping commands, create a daemon that recieves requests and then fires off the appropriate command and arguments for you

2020-12-31 09:26:22	kerframil	oh yeah.

2020-12-31 09:26:45	kerframil	the OS also has some sort of smart-quoting bullshit which certain shitty IRC clients might integrate with. just to make matters worse.

2020-12-31 09:27:48	earnestly	kerframil: The POSIX manuals don't guard \- so the end up becoming n and m dashes

2020-12-31 09:31:04	earnestly	kerframil: Hm, now that it's mentioned, the next time I encounter this I'll see if I can send a patch to kerrisk since the posix manuals come from man-pages on linux
2020-12-31 09:31:24	earnestly	I assume it's just a case of forgetting to add \- in the troff source
2020-12-31 09:31:26	austin001	another thing I am trying to get working is to pipe stdin to a perl script using echo. it works on the prompt but not in my script inside the loop. Is there something I should make sure of to do this?
2020-12-31 09:31:27	kerframil	earnestly: good idea. searching man pages is enough pain as it is.
2020-12-31 09:32:02	earnestly	austin001: for loop; do printf ...; done | perl

2020-12-31 09:37:18	austin001	if I do echo y | in bash prompt it sends the y properly. If I do this in the loop in my script it still prompts for input and doesnt receive the echo'd y

2020-12-31 09:38:37	earnestly	You will need to quote both of those "$1" and "$2", also consider that you're exposing passwords and usernames to ps(1) output
2020-12-31 09:39:59	kerframil	in any case, my $response = <STDIN> is fine, in and as of itself. the problem is with your script.

2020-12-31 11:28:33	superboot	Hi all. I'd like to know if there is a way to add a key-value pair to an associative array by nameref. Eg. declare -A x; x[a]=123; declare -n y; y=x; y[b]=456;
2020-12-31 11:28:36	superboot	#declare -A x; x[a]=123; declare -n y; y=x; y[b]=456;
2020-12-31 11:28:45	superboot	# declare -A x; x[a]=123; declare -n y; y=x; y[b]=456;
2020-12-31 11:28:46	shbot	superboot: no output
2020-12-31 11:28:46	kerframil	if it indirectly interrupted. say, by the shell receiving a signal.
2020-12-31 11:29:08	kerframil	so either your writer is closing prematurely or ... something else is going on.
2020-12-31 11:30:21	superboot	Ok, my example code worked... so I guess that answers my question.

2021-01-01 11:17:40	jack1901	eschwartz: So if my understanding is correct while only creates a new subshell if you try and pipe something to it, right?
2021-01-01 11:17:54	jack1901	in which case the STDIN of that entire subshell becomes whatever was piped into i
2021-01-01 11:18:30	jack1901	is piping things to builtin commands POSIX compliant?
2021-01-01 11:18:42	phy1729	yes
2021-01-01 11:19:27	jack1901	phy1729: to my description of how while works or my last questioN?
2021-01-01 11:19:29	jack1901	or both?
2021-01-01 11:19:34	mknod	jack1901, with shopt -s lastpipe, the last command of a pipe doesn't create a new subshell
2021-01-01 11:19:38	phy1729	last question
2021-01-01 11:19:57	jack1901	mknod: interesting
2021-01-01 11:20:04	jack1901	through I am more interested in default/POSIX behaviour
2021-01-01 11:20:04	phy1729	it's more that pipes (by default as noted by mknod) create subshells
2021-01-01 11:20:15	mknod	jack1901, command or compound command, which a while statement basically is
2021-01-01 11:20:25	jack1901	yes, that is my understanding

2021-01-01 11:20:27	mknod	jack1901, good luck then :p
2021-01-01 11:20:42	phy1729	# foo() { (( a++ )); foo; echo $a; : | foo; echo $a
2021-01-01 11:20:48	shbot	phy1729: Missing terminating quote, bracket or keyword
2021-01-01 11:20:52	phy1729	dammit
2021-01-01 11:20:55	jack1901	but since while is a builtin it wasn't clear that it creates a new subshell
2021-01-01 11:21:06	phy1729	# foo() { (( a++ )); }; foo; echo $a; : | foo; echo $a
2021-01-01 11:21:07	mknod	jack1901, it's not

2021-01-01 11:21:14	mknod	# type while
2021-01-01 11:21:15	shbot	mknod: while is a shell keyword
2021-01-01 11:21:31	phy1729	because the pipe caused the second foo to run in a subshell
2021-01-01 11:21:46	phy1729	it's more often noticed with loops, but it's the pipe

2021-01-01 11:22:24	jack1901	phy1729: thanks

2021-01-01 11:22:46	jack1901	but just to confirm, is it POSIX behaviour to treat functions as programs which run under new subshell?
2021-01-01 11:22:53	jack1901	i.e can you always pipe to them?
2021-01-01 11:22:57	mknod	yes
2021-01-01 11:23:13	jack1901	this has been quite educational
2021-01-01 11:23:16	jack1901	thanks :)

2021-01-01 11:26:51	jack1901	someone mentioned it being possible to pass functions to find's exec argument
2021-01-01 11:26:54	jack1901	but this doesn't seem to work
2021-01-01 11:26:56	jack1901	# t() { echo "Hello world"; };find /tmp/ -exec bash -c 't' \;
2021-01-01 11:26:57	shbot	jack1901: bash: t: command not found
2021-01-01 11:27:16	jack1901	I wouldn't expect it to, since my understanding is that t is a function in the local shell
2021-01-01 11:27:19	mknod	what happens in Bash stays in Bash
2021-01-01 11:27:28	jack1901	yes, that's what I thought
2021-01-01 11:28:38	phy1729	You can export functions, but don't. Just define the function in the called shell
2021-01-01 11:29:55	jack1901	I assume that is
2021-01-01 11:29:57	jack1901	# t() { echo "Hello world"; };export -f t;find /tmp/ -exec bash -c 't' \;
2021-01-01 11:29:59	shbot	jack1901: Hello world
2021-01-01 11:30:05	jack1901	but that is bash specific
2021-01-01 11:30:09	jack1901	if I understand correctly
2021-01-01 11:31:05	mknod	the thing is, it's very fragile, and doesn't ease life much
2021-01-01 11:31:39	jack1901	agreed, I wouldn't use something like that in practice
2021-01-01 11:31:46	phy1729	and was the cause of shellshock
2021-01-01 11:31:54	mknod	if you do need functions, you'll most likely need to write a small wrapper to make -exec happy
2021-01-01 11:32:32	jack1901	I prefer to make my ships POSIX compliant when possible
