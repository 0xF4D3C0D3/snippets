2020-12-19 07:43:18	yjftsjthsd	Huh. So in the interest of getting us on the same page: When docker creates a container, it patches together the container's "root filesystem" by using overlayfs to merge together image layers. My reading of the error you get is that when it tries to actually run something, it can't find the user spec in the passwd file for the root user (UID 0)
2020-12-19 07:43:18	yjftsjthsd	because it can't find the passwd file because the path that should be the passwd file (user list) is somehow a directory.
2020-12-19 07:43:48	yjftsjthsd	If it's not much effort, you might try that, I guess, but it's such a bizarre error that I can't think how it could happen
2020-12-19 07:43:49	mmance	I could spin up other containers and they work as expected
2020-12-19 07:43:59	yjftsjthsd	It might be more interesting to try Ubuntu 20.04 or something
2020-12-19 07:44:08	mmance	I can do that
2020-12-19 07:44:32	mmance	I am so new at this, it is most likely something I am doing wrong
2020-12-19 07:44:49	yjftsjthsd	Typing this from an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, I can assure you that docker works on it:) I'd be shocked if Ubuntu 20.10 managed to break it, but I haven't actually tried
2020-12-19 07:45:28	yjftsjthsd	Of course rancher is a wildcard here, but again that'd be a weird thing to break stuff, especially with that error
2020-12-19 07:45:36	mmance	my apologies, it is 20.04
2020-12-19 07:45:54	mmance	Let me try a fresh one, maybe I just biffed something along the way.

2020-12-20 05:43:27	tang^	looking at that documentation, they're using a v2 docker-compose config and copying jellyfin configurations from the official jellyfin project

2020-12-20 05:44:15	SenoraRaton	It built, I connected. It was working.
2020-12-20 05:44:30	SenoraRaton	Then I changed file permissions, and now it is no longer working because root doesn't own the directory anymore

2020-12-20 22:56:49	Flintlocke89	Anyhows, I'm very new to Docker (and Linux) and so far I love Docker for the ease of use. However I've been running everything from seperate docker-compose.yml's in their own little subdirectories like ~/docker/nginx/docker-compose.yml and ~/docker/portainer/docker-compose.yml. Now according to my friend (who didn't elaborate) and a cursory google
2020-12-20 22:56:49	Flintlocke89	this seems to be wrong, I should be using the whole lot in one big docker-compose which just seems terribly confusing. Are there any real downsides or drawbacks to my seperated method?
2020-12-20 22:56:49	akik	eggbean: it's a desktop application solution for windows and mac
2020-12-20 22:57:08	akik	eggbean: it's running a linux vm on those systems where dockerd is running inside of the linux vm
2020-12-20 22:57:18	eggbean	akik: but does it run mac/windows applications or linux?

2020-12-20 23:25:22	blink	its not exactly wrong
2020-12-20 23:25:28	blink	its a different build of structure
2020-12-20 23:25:47	blink	you can put them all in one folder and re-name the .yaml files to portainer.yml, nginx.yml etc
2020-12-20 23:26:08	blink	then call it with docker-compose -f portainer.yml -f nginx.yml -up -d
2020-12-20 23:26:14	blink	mind the docker-compose.override.yml file
2020-12-20 23:26:45	blink	im not quite sure what's to gain from putting it all in one folder vs having it all separate
2020-12-20 23:26:57	blink	besides internal/external docker networking
2020-12-20 23:27:06	blink	and reaching volumes
2020-12-20 23:28:03	Flintlocke89	Ooh, thank you. It's good to know that's an option anyway.
2020-12-20 23:28:13	blink	yea man i keep it all compartmentalized
2020-12-20 23:28:15	blink	i separate my shit
2020-12-20 23:28:17	Flintlocke89	Isn't the networking/volumes stuff all just handled by Docker anyway?
2020-12-20 23:28:24	blink	yea but like
2020-12-20 23:28:29	blink	when you go from one docker-compose file to another
2020-12-20 23:28:35	blink	the folder calls the volume name
2020-12-20 23:28:55	blink	it adds to the volume name*
2020-12-20 23:29:02	blink	so like, if you had lets say alpine-mariadb
2020-12-20 23:29:09	blink	where you're using it as your masterdb and 4 other containers are connecting to it
2020-12-20 23:29:26	blink	if you dont want to do networks:  foonet:  external: true
2020-12-20 23:29:27	artok	I repeat: docker-compose yml is "just docker cli commands"
2020-12-20 23:30:14	blink	but there are reasons why you may want to do it within 1 yml file, we all get its just docker cli commands
2020-12-20 23:30:20	blink	but what you also have to understand is docker is just a framework
2020-12-20 23:30:25	blink	you can build on containerd without it
2020-12-20 23:30:40	blink	so in reality its just CLI period, not docker cli
2020-12-20 23:30:59	Flintlocke89	Whatever it is, I think it's magical.
2020-12-20 23:31:11	Flintlocke89	Anyway thanks blink!
2020-12-20 23:31:37	blink	no worries man, just remember you're not doing it 'wrong' its just a different way of doing it
2020-12-20 23:31:48	blink	i have the same setup you use
2020-12-20 23:32:08	Flintlocke89	Always good to double-check though. Just started out a few days ago.
2020-12-20 23:32:15	blink	well just remember this
2020-12-20 23:32:24	blink	volume names are called by the folder name

2020-12-20 23:32:48	blink	so you'd have to create image names for everything and make sure you know what's what if you are using volumes properly
2020-12-20 23:32:58	Flintlocke89	Spent 4 hours yesterday pulling my hair out because my samba share was doing weird shit, only to realise the example docker-compose had a second volumes: entry under my screen cutoff.
2020-12-20 23:32:59	artok	...unless given name for the stack in docker-compose parameters
2020-12-20 23:33:04	blink	i dont know if you're calling static files with ./data:/whatever
2020-12-20 23:33:06	Flintlocke89	Cue rage.
2020-12-20 23:33:22	artok	..and docker swarm stack name on that environment
2020-12-20 23:33:34	blink	oh you can do that artok, what about without swarm?
2020-12-20 23:33:41	blink	cause im not going to use swarm, kubernetes...
2020-12-20 23:34:28	artok	normal docker-compose --help gives -p parameter (short for --project-name)
2020-12-20 23:34:28	Flintlocke89	I think that's the way I;m calling static files, yes.
2020-12-20 23:35:17	blink	do i have to add -p every time or can i add something to docker-compose.yml to identify the volume name something other than the folder
2020-12-20 23:35:19	Flintlocke89	I'm just finding stuff and bodging the bits that seem necessary or specific to my setup, this is just a little celeron NUC to run jellyfish and a reverse proxy.
2020-12-20 23:35:48	Flintlocke89	Maybe a pihole if I;m feeling spicy.
2020-12-20 23:36:24	artok	it is the identity of the stack, so you have it on all commands that are into that same, let's say it now "namespace"
2020-12-20 23:37:21	blink	lol
2020-12-20 23:37:46	artok	docker-compose is adding that project name (defaulted by directory name) as prefix for all names and volumes that aren't specified by external, so you can select your way of working from there

2020-12-21 00:15:48	blink	its not the /lib/ folder, the /run/
2020-12-21 00:16:12	blink	if docker commands hang again, do you recommend this method or docker system prune -a
2020-12-21 00:17:01	artok	if all commands hang, sure, you need to stop the daemon and flush the run dir
2020-12-21 00:17:20	artok	sometimes plain restart of the dockerd helps
2020-12-21 00:18:09	artok	but also in that situation you need to check for the actual reason for the hanging

2020-12-21 02:18:39	artok	s6 seems to try to do chown abc:abc for the directories
2020-12-21 02:18:49	artok	and the data
2020-12-21 02:19:21	SenoraRaton	And they have the wrong ownership because I ran sudo on them, and didn't add the user to the docker group
2020-12-21 02:19:49	SenoraRaton	So "hopefully" by adding my user to the docker group, and never running any docker commands as sudo, it "might" work.  That is our current working theory that we are about to test
2020-12-21 02:20:11	artok	container should start with root permissions, and then just demotion on service run

2020-12-21 02:21:00	artok	that would make sure it has correct permissions to run.. might break something outside container but still, it would make container service to run
2020-12-21 02:21:30	artok	even if you add youself to docker group, you'll start container with root permissions

2020-12-22 05:27:57	Alina-malina	wyoung, what if someone finds a vulnrability in your server and when you start your container that intruder get into your container, exploit shell, and get a root into your host machine?
2020-12-22 05:28:32	tabakhase	wyoung one more layer to crack - and nice for runtimes that have no root (openshift i think?) - but also yea, its one of the kinda last things to worry about... anyone who has the 0day to jump out of the container, wont be stopped by elevating from user->root ;D

2020-12-22 05:33:44	cim209	Containers != VMs
2020-12-22 05:34:12	cim209	Containers are just basically processes
2020-12-22 05:34:32	Alina-malina	wyoung, why you so sure about docker images then that you are pooling from dockerhub? they may be compromized
2020-12-22 05:34:40	wyoung	Processes that are run as a docker user in the host system?
2020-12-22 05:35:29	Alina-malina	wyoung, what if someone hack those images and place a rootkit in kernel0 ring and wait until u pull it to get a reverse shell and then exploit that container to get into your host?
2020-12-22 05:35:52	subsume3	that sounds like a serious flaw in computers
2020-12-22 05:36:02	Alina-malina	it has nothing to do with computers xD
2020-12-22 05:36:10	wyoung	Alina-malina: Did I say I was pooliong from dockerhub?  I am talking about the differences in running a webapp inside a container as root as apposed to running it as a user.  I ma trying to figure out what can be done as root that can't be done as a user.  So far you haven't given me any example that both root and a user can't do.
2020-12-22 05:36:20	NOTevil	running as root, there would be access to the package manager.  unless you removed it from the image.
2020-12-22 05:36:25	Alina-malina	wyoung, even worther
2020-12-22 05:36:56	Alina-malina	if you going to build your own image for your container, you may mess up everything there and that image will be hosted somewhere with weak passwort or misconfigured

A compromised container can't access the image as root or as a user, so the changes are lost at restart time.  I am not connecting any external file system to it so no state is being saved between restarts, even if it was, mounting a read only FS can't be written by root either.
2020-12-22 05:47:10	wyoung	I guess root can run a process to listen on ports below 1024, however I am using security groups / firewall to only allow connections from the load balancer.

2020-12-22 06:25:55	NOTevil	you could use some other build setup.  run an image to create your build artifacts -> copy to mounted directory, then build final image from there.

2020-12-23 00:01:56	@programmerq	serard▸ docker's default networking driver doesn't allow direct routing to containers from an external network. It treats the container network as a private network. If something outside the docker host needs to access a container, you publish the port and access it by the host's ip address.

2020-12-23 00:04:35	@programmerq	I'm sure you could hack something together, but you'll be going against the grain as long as you're using the default networking driver. What's your usecase that makes you not want to publish ports?

2020-12-23 00:07:51	serard	what are the networks I can use for that usecase ?
2020-12-23 00:08:18	@programmerq	the solution is to put them behind a reverse proxy. traefik is a project that is a reverse proxy that'll auto configure itself based on container labels.
2020-12-23 00:09:28	@programmerq	otherwise, you could set up an nginx with a static config that will reverse proxy to your containers.
2020-12-23 00:09:34	@programmerq	or whatever else you're comfortable with
2020-12-23 00:09:38	sveinse	programmerq: Is there actually someone using volumes? Everywhere I see, this being no exception, seems to prefer bind mounts. hmm...
2020-12-23 00:10:33	@programmerq	sveinse▸ volumes 100% get utilization. If you want non-root users to access the data, that's really more why bind mounts are a thing. volumes are for when you want to keep everything in docker and only access it from containers.

2020-12-23 00:11:26	@programmerq	I am of the opinion that people overuse bind mounts, but a lot of tutorials go with bind mounts since it's slightly easier to understand for absolute docker beginners that just want to use whatever the thing is that the tutorial is really about.
2020-12-23 00:11:37	@programmerq	so the effect is a lot of folks end up using bind mounts as a go-to

2020-12-23 00:12:26	sveinse	Yeah, I'm using volumes when I can because I think its neat to have a central registry of the mounts. But as you say, outside access isn't what it's made for
2020-12-23 00:13:02	@programmerq	if this user that needs outside access is trying to do code in an IDE that's available to the container, then that's definitely a bind mount usecase.
2020-12-23 00:13:38	@programmerq	if that user has access to docker and the just want to poke around or do ls or cp or whatever, then they could potentially just fire up an interactive container with that volume attached and do what's needed.
2020-12-23 00:14:19	sveinse	Jep. The other complexity of the IDE use case is that many containers run as root, while you don't really want a user access as root.

2020-12-24 06:11:55	echelon	so docker-compose by default launches all container services at the same time?
2020-12-24 06:12:24	artok	there is depends_on but it doesn't make sure that service is actually up
2020-12-24 06:12:45	echelon	oh, i don't actually need to check if it's up, i just want it to complete
2020-12-24 06:13:04	echelon	it's just a build job

2020-12-24 06:13:19	artok	uh
2020-12-24 06:14:31	artok	your use case might need shell script rather than compose
2020-12-24 06:15:14	echelon	hmm ok
2020-12-24 06:15:19	artok	compose is great for service stack and runtime configurations, for CI kind of things it will be bunch of docker run --rm commands
2020-12-24 06:15:20	echelon	thanks
2020-12-24 06:15:36	echelon	yeah, i'm starting to see that :/

2020-12-24 06:16:49	SenoraRaton	So in the documentation for the deluge container it says network_mode:host is required, however its causing conflicts and I need to set it to bridge, is there a way to reconcile these two things?
2020-12-24 06:17:05	greatgatsby	echelon, a Makefile can actually be very handy for stuff like this

2020-12-24 06:17:23	artok	usually you start your builder service with compose, sure, but that might then use docker socket to create volume, copy source code to it, start build image with mounted volume, then if it is succesful, there comes another container that will pack things up and finally the build volume is removed

2020-12-25 07:51:50	pacmanfan	i mean, i could script turning one port on at a time and reconfiguring them, but that would make a given batch take much longer than doing them all in parallel.
2020-12-25 07:52:04	Celmor[m]1	and using multiple  network namespaces or virtual routing tables to use the same subnet on differing vlans
2020-12-25 07:52:11	pacmanfan	yeah, i want to use vlans, i'm just not sure of the docker networking side

2020-12-25 07:52:54	pacmanfan	i see docker has macvlan mode, but i'm unsure how it will handle overlapping subnets
2020-12-25 07:53:10	BtbN	I still don't see how that relates to docker
2020-12-25 07:53:22	pacmanfan	this guide gets me pretty close to what i want: https://hicu.be/docker-networking-macvlan-vlan-configuration
2020-12-25 07:53:26	BtbN	multiple physical devices with the exact same IP on the same network will cause breakage
2020-12-25 07:53:34	Celmor[m]1	docker can't handle overlapping networks, I've tried that myself
2020-12-25 07:53:35	BtbN	Nothing docker can do about that, fix your network
2020-12-25 07:53:56	Celmor[m]1	BtbN: there's no breakage if they are on different vlans
2020-12-25 07:54:27	pacmanfan	<Celmor[m]1> docker can't handle overlapping networks, I've tried that myself  << do you know if this is true when they are on separate vlans?
2020-12-25 07:54:47	pacmanfan	like a 1:1 container:vlan setup, all with the same ip/subnet
2020-12-25 07:55:04	BtbN	You mean one box being in multiple vlans, which have the exact same subnet on them? That's just plain not a sane setup, entirely independend of docker.
2020-12-25 07:55:16	BtbN	IP + Subnet
2020-12-25 07:55:20	Celmor[m]1	yeah, I've tried putting the networks on different vlans, but you can only create 1 macvlan with that one subnet, as soon as you try to create another macvlan network with the same subnet config docker will complain
2020-12-25 07:55:33	BtbN	rightfully so
2020-12-25 07:55:38	BtbN	like, what do you expect it to do?
2020-12-25 07:55:46	pacmanfan	with virtual routing tables (vrf i think?) i don't see the problem.
2020-12-25 07:55:56	pacmanfan	Celmor[m]1, thank you. that is exactly what i was wanting to know
2020-12-25 07:56:02	BtbN	It's ultra ambiguous. Just don't do that.
2020-12-25 07:56:15	Celmor[m]1	you could try creating the network namespaces manually to access each vlan/network (but same ip range) and route from your docker container into there from the host
2020-12-25 07:57:34	Celmor[m]1	BtbN: well, docker does support network namespaces but it tries to make the subnet accessible from the host which sometimes isn't necessary, if you see the network as completely isolated from the host there's no routing problem docker would have to deal with

2020-12-25 07:57:57	Celmor[m]1	you can easily do it manually with namespaces and virtual nics, docker just doesn't cover that "use case"
2020-12-25 07:59:55	Celmor[m]1	what I've done to access overlapping subnets without actually routing into them as that causes issues (without multiple vrf's) is just spawning a proxy in each of the namespaces, making that accessible using a veth pair and using that

2020-12-25 08:03:59	pacmanfan	manually could be worth a shot, i think.
2020-12-25 08:04:15	pacmanfan	that's pretty independent of docker, but will work with the containers?
2020-12-25 08:04:42	pacmanfan	the other route i'm looking at is doing it all on my router, with vrfs and 1:1 NAT.
2020-12-25 08:04:58	pacmanfan	then i could do it all from one host, no need to containerize it.
2020-12-25 08:05:02	Celmor[m]1	your containers won't be "aware" of these subnets, you'd have to setup routes manually, e.g. if coming from that subnet or bridge interface and this is the destination subnet route using this nic

2020-12-25 08:05:55	pacmanfan	that sounds like a pretty workable problem
2020-12-25 08:05:57	Celmor[m]1	if you don't need containers... I mean they don't really give you an advantage. whatever process you're running you can put into the namespace with your vlan endpoint
2020-12-25 08:09:39	pacmanfan	ohhh, nice. the only reason i was going for containers was i thought it would ease the network segmentation side--i didn't know that was doable with native linux, actually. i'm working it backwards, kind of. my initial thought was to use VM guests and drop each into their own VLAN, but that is a lot of overhead. on the other side i was looking at 1:1 nat and VRFs and doing it all on my router, but that feels like a bit of a bodge. i'm unfamiliar with
2020-12-25 08:09:40	pacmanfan	docker, but i suspected it gave containers the same networking features that vm guests have on most hypervisors... wasn't even thinking about it being doable on one host without docker.

2020-12-26 09:09:14	chovy	how should i deploy docker-compose to a dedicated server? Right now I'm just rsyncing the files to the server and running `docker-compose up -d`
2020-12-26 09:09:22	chovy	is that normal or is that rookie way
2020-12-26 09:09:48	chovy	i thought there was a way to deploy a built container, but i havefn't found any info on that
2020-12-26 09:10:07	chovy	so instead of building on the production server i build locally and push that somehow

2020-12-26 11:06:01	DeeJayTwo	The second interface is just for some local monitoring

2020-12-26 20:27:41	Intelo	yes

2020-12-26 20:28:13	Intelo	no
2020-12-26 20:28:25	gordonjcp	hm, okay, what about chroot?
2020-12-26 20:28:31	Intelo	that I know
2020-12-26 20:28:41	Intelo	chroot jails?
2020-12-26 20:28:46	gordonjcp	okay so containers are like a mega chroot
2020-12-26 20:28:54	Intelo	Ok..
2020-12-26 20:29:16	gordonjcp	you're not running a virtual machine and everything is running off the host's kernel
2020-12-26 20:30:20	Intelo	Ya, I know. mysql is a chroot. postgres would be another. But where is the 'base system'? e.g if I just want to install ubuntu in docker. Then after that I do install ALL other things manually with 'apt install mysql' etc. I know this is not docker way but what if I do it with docker shell?

2020-12-26 20:32:00	gordonjcp	Intelo: so what happens is the containers are in "layers"
2020-12-26 20:32:46	gordonjcp	Intelo: if you install a mysql container, it'd have a "bare" Ubuntu filesystem layer, pretty stripped down usually, and then another layer on top with mysql packages installed
2020-12-26 20:33:16	Intelo	yes, I understand
2020-12-26 20:33:26	Intelo	but my question is:
2020-12-26 20:33:40	gordonjcp	Intelo: one of the clever bits is that if you then install another Ubuntu-based container you are still using the first layer
2020-12-26 20:33:43	gordonjcp	only one Ubuntu layer

2020-12-26 20:34:06	Intelo	hm
2020-12-26 20:34:22	gordonjcp	the stuff you do to the container is then in yet another layer
2020-12-26 20:34:25	Intelo	what if I just want to install ubuntu in docker. Then after that I do install ALL other things manually with 'apt install mysql' etc. and just use that shell? won't it act like a vm?
2020-12-26 20:34:45	gordonjcp	so you could have a whole bunch of Ubuntu-based Mysql containers all running completely separate mysql databases
2020-12-26 20:34:55	gordonjcp	Intelo: it will
2020-12-26 20:34:56	Intelo	I gett it.
2020-12-26 20:35:02	Intelo	gordonjcp: oh it will?
2020-12-26 20:35:04	gordonjcp	it's not the most convenient way to do it, but it works
2020-12-26 20:35:06	gordonjcp	sure
2020-12-26 20:35:26	Intelo	so in that case, a vm ubuntu === docker image?
2020-12-26 20:35:39	gordonjcp	no
2020-12-26 20:35:41	gordonjcp	it's not a VM
2020-12-26 20:35:49	Intelo	it will act like one
2020-12-26 20:35:51	Intelo	no?
2020-12-26 20:35:59	gordonjcp	no, it'll act like a container
2020-12-26 20:36:18	gordonjcp	although in a sense you can think of it as similar to a VM
2020-12-26 20:36:20	gordonjcp	tell you what
2020-12-26 20:36:27	gordonjcp	you might want to also look into Vagrant
2020-12-26 20:36:42	gordonjcp	which parcels up VMs or docker containers into a reusable thing you can tar up
2020-12-26 20:37:22	Intelo	so if I 'docker save ..' and then 'docker load ... ' somewhere else, Isn't that equal to copying the image to another place/system as if I did that to a .vdk/.vm file?
2020-12-26 20:37:45	gordonjcp	I haven't played with docker save and docker load
2020-12-26 20:38:03	gordonjcp	keeping a "gold master" image around is kind of the wrong way to do it
2020-12-26 20:38:09	Intelo	ok. If I do not have to download anything while doing that, I guess thats it

2020-12-26 20:39:17	gordonjcp	well, I mean, part of the wider philosophy is that the Dockerfile is part of your site documentation
